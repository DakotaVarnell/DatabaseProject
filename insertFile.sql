It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years.

	values('ur86657061','I commend Coppola for taking on Pt 2 and filling in a bit of Viteo Corleones history, and continuing Michaels saga, with parallels between the two. It was a good sequel, but I didnt find it as engaging as the first one, which Ive seen countless number of times. I just watched Pt 2 recently after not having seen it for a number of years. Im not sure why it doesnt have the same feeling as the first. I think the lack of direction (i.e. a clear plot line) didnt help. There was an attempt on Michaels life, and there was talk here and there of doing some extra business, but a lot of it just seemed vague. Much of the movie was spent on the strained relationship between Michael and his family. Another missed opportunity was explaining Don Vito Corleones rise to power. You see him assassinate the neighbourhood Don at one point, but then we fast forward years later when hes grown a mustache and is doing favors for people, and vice versa. But we dont get any information on whether hes affiliated with the crime boss that was the boss of the guy he killed, or if he had formed a completely different family. I guess that would have been a 4.5hr movie. Overall, a good, but not great sequel. Not as quotable either, like the first movie. Did it deserve the Best Oscar Nom and Win. I guess so. There were a lot of great movies that year. But I think the juggernaut of the Godfather saga was too much to pass up giving it the win.',7,'20 November 2019','0071562');

I have viewed it on multiple occasions... But to be honest, I cannot remember exactly when I saw it for the first time!I must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950s is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?Leaving that issue aside, lets focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. With each viewing, I have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more!As someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 ANGRY MEN lets You totally get into the head of each and every character... As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!If You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST! If perhaps, You saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... I beseech You to revisit it!

Some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent Liam Neeson who plays Oskar Schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. Like many Spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter.

	values('ur1931776','Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helms Deep. `Return of the King opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers, at thats the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring, provided heaps of exposition on the rings importance and influence, and in `Return of the King, we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers, but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Woods performance is so critical to the film because it determines the rings power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King, Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return as a mix of `Fellowship and `Two Towers, with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking.',0,'16 December 2003','0167260');

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.',10,'9 January 2005','0110912');

	values('ur1572688','...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, Im 25 years old, and Ive read "The Lord of the Rings" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with "The Hobbit" and "The Silmarillion" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbos table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in "The Hobbit" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of Fellowship of the Ring lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? Ive read a reviewer saying hed make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with Alvin and the Chimpmunks kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jacksons vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jacksons, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; thats the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried "ranger". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, hes willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the best friend everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I cant wait for his return.Quite frankly, I cant wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, Ill watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25Â¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.',10,'30 January 2002','0120737');

This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialogue, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that Id seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. This was unique; 3 people?! You cant do that. But Leone did, and he did it brilliantly - all cameras and music. I have now seen this film too many times to count but Ill be back for another blast of buono, brutto, cattivo, someday. My son owes his name to this film. Yep, that there is Clinton.',10,'9 December 1998','0060196');

	values('ur2707735','For anyone who grew up in the turbulent Sixties, "Forrest Gump" delivers a clever blend of nostalgia mixed with a uniquely creative view of history as experienced by a presumed to be simpleton. While Tom Hanks character recalls his life with a slow tangy drawl, he variously entertains and educates a host of passengers waiting for the next bus to their intended destination. Some ignore him, some show interest, one even scorns Gumps tale of getting rich in the shrimping business, only to depart before Forrest has a chance to pull out his copy of Fortune Magazine. Life can be like that for those unwilling to listen and learn, casting doubt instead of exploring the truth and keeping an open mind.I got a kick out of Forrests string of brushes with greatness - the way he taught Elvis how to shake his hips, his unquestioning response to LBJs inquiry about his war injury, and the way his war time experience inspired John Lennon to write Imagine. There was also that ingenious sequence in which he meets President Nixon, then inadvertently tips off the Watergate scandal. However the most understated and easiest reference to miss was the clever homage paid to the 1969 film "Midnight Cowboy", when Forrest wheels Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise) across busy city traffic, and is narrowly missed by a taxi cab. Lt. Dans response was "Hey, Im walkin here", just the way Ratso Rizzo did in that earlier film. All that with the Everybody Talking at Me movie theme seamlessly woven in as so many songs of that era were utilized with other aspects of the story.For Forrest Gump, life is not a pretentious path to wealth or fame, but a never ending quest to learn and be a productive human being. Not to mention finding ones own true love. For Forrest, life long friend Jenny (Robin Wright) represents an unfulfilled ideal, one he accepts into his heart while still a young schoolboy and nurturing that relationship platonically throughout his adulthood. For her part, Jenny represents a youthful quest for experiencing life to the fullest, only to make a series of wrong choices that lead her to the brink of suicide. Its fitting that Jenny eventually realizes what Forrest knew all along, that they were made for each other even if outward appearances seemed to dictate otherwise.Ive seen this film only a couple times in the past, thinking it was good, but only considering it for its entertainment value. I guess one of the benefits of getting older is the insight one gains with experiencing life a day at a time and steady as she goes. My viewing of the picture today gave me a greater appreciation for the subtleties offered in the film, and leads me to believe the world would be a better place if there were a little more of Forrest Gump in all of us.',10,'12 June 2011','0109830');

	values('ur4064696','The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the films narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesnt stop the film from being an experience that people shouldnt be cheated out of.The acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hills character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellens character, Gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise, Hugo Weavings character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief, because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghans and Billy Boyds characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir, played by David Wenham, and Gollum, played beautifully by Andy Serkis. Ill get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.The effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helms Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helms Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isnt the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but Im not going to spoil them so youll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.Some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenhams character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenhams character. Dramatic purposes.Overall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.10/10 - On my top 10 of best films',10,'13 June 2006','0167261');

	values('ur3312099','Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolans Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didnt like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com',10,'12 July 2010','1375666');

	values('ur1714901','The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. Its a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. Its really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!Itd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, theres a couple of sequels on the way, so lets see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isnt by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.Im yet to meet somebody who hasnt enjoyed it. Its my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too.',10,'23 April 2002','0133093');

	values('ur26976606','Would you go to a mental hospital to avoid a prison sentence? One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a story of patients in a mental hospital and how their life was changed by R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, arrived in the ward to avoid going to prison or working on a work farm and he made an impact. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a memorable story that goes down in history as one of the best. Lets start with the characters. Nicholson plays R.P. McMurphy, a criminal who has history of violence and aggression. He was sent to the asylum after acting erratic on the work farms. He isnt really mentally insane, but he fakes it to avoid going to prison. He thinks he can serve his sentence in the asylum and life will be easy. In the asylum we have Billy Bibbit, a nervous stuttering man with depression and anxiety. Cheswick is a nervous man who also struggles with anxiety. The actor who portrays him did a great job in playing the part. Danny Devito, yes little Danny Devito before he really went nuts, plays Martini, a lovable character. Then theres the Chief. Chief is a 65" mute who everyone thinks is dumb as a rock. He turns out to be one of the most important and influential characters. McMurphy originally goes into the ward to avoid prison but he eventually helps the patients in there. He thinks some of them could survive in the real world and he ends up giving the other patients confidence and a type of therapy. Billy eventually stops stuttering for a little bit. Harding has more self control and Cheswick learns to stick up for what he believes in. An example of McMurphys "therapy" is the fishing trip. McMurphy climbs over the fence and steals a bus with the patients from his ward. He takes them to a fishing boat and takes them fishing. McMurphy had his own agenda but he also helps the patients. He gives them an experience a normal man would have and they have fun. One of the best aspects of this movie is the accuracy to the time period. Men with mental illnesses were put in asylums like the one we see in the film. They experienced the different types of therapy. They took drugs such as anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti- depressants. Any means to help them relax and make them acceptable for society. They experienced group therapy, which we see often throughout, and something Ive never seen before in hydrotherapy. Unfortunately, during this time period there were a lot of problems. If people were overly aggressive or considered dangerous they would undergo electroshock therapy. Basically, doctors tie you down and put conducting gel on your temples and a rubber mouth guard in your mouth so you dont bite your tongue. Then they literally send a shock through your temples into your brain. The idea was to reset the brain and make you more relaxed and in control. The audience witnesss electroshock therapy in the film and it is a little disturbing to watch. You can see the suffering on their faces. Finally there is the lobotomy, where doctors drill into the skull or go through the nose to scrape out a piece of your brain. This turns a man into a vegetable who can barely survive on their own. It is illegal today but back then it was common. Character relationships are important for a successful movie and not many compare to the relationship McMurphy had with the vile Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched was the head nurse in the ward. She controlled the groups and she was in charge. Her character is difficult because I couldnt ever really tell what her intentions were. Sometimes she tried hard to help the patients and other times she acted like she wanted to make them worse. A prime example is the one therapy group when Cheswick wants his cigarettes and Nurse Ratched just ignores him. Cheswick grows a backbone and stands up for himself and Ratched tries to put him back in his place and treat him like a dog. That scene really changes the movie and the major events of the movie unfold from there. McMurphy and Ratched would clash all the time. McMurphy would get under her skin and she under his. It made the movie really entertaining and a little comedic at times. Now no movie is perfect and I did have a few problems with it. Mainly it was the ending. It was a fine ending but I feel like it was a little too drastic. I dont want to give it away but it was one of those moments where you smack your forehead and go, "you idiot." When you see the movie you will know what I mean. Also what happens to one of the patients is completely unnecessary. I understand he was upset but he didnt have to do what he did. It was a little ridiculous and I cant see it really happening. Overall, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a great movie with excellent characters, a well written script, an interesting, and entertaining storyline. It deserves all the credit it got and will go down as a career making movie for Jack Nicholson. He did a fantastic job and deserved the Oscar he won. This is not what I would call a "background movie." Meaning, it is not something you can watch casually. You need to sit down and watch it and pay full attention. Thats my advice and without a shadow of a doubt, One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and is something I can watch again and again and enjoy every time.',8,'28 November 2012','0073486');

	values('ur1669095','The movie, "Se7en", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichÃ©s. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieris seven deadly sins from "The Divine Comedy", sets out to, "preach" about mans impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the films conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7ens surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7ens poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90s. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.Score 10/10',10,'25 March 2002','0114369');

Even though they play it every year for Christmas, I never really had an interest to see it again. I was complaining to my mom the other day how sad it is that people just look at Christmas as present time and just getting what you want, I almost cried over it because I miss how my family would get me presents, but wed go the homeless shelter to help out people who couldnt have a better one than us, I always thanked my parents for those wonderful experiences. It taught me that there is always worse and we must help those not just on Christmas, but all year around. Well, we did it again this year, but Im now in the retail business and when I complained about this to my mom, she lent me the movie and said to watch it.Watching this movie truly touched my heart and brought me back to the true meaning of Christmas. I mean, your heart just goes out to George and his wonderful little town of Bedford Falls. He and his wonderful wife Mary together do whatever they can to make it in life and support their 4 darling children. But when a horrible mishap goes on at the bank that George works at, loosing $8,000, he starts to wonder if his life is worth living. But there is one angel who will not give up on him and shows him what life would be like if George had never been born. In Bedford Falls without George, turned into Pottersville because of the very greedy business man Mr. Potter, no one is happy and Mary is all alone. George realizes that maybe life is worth living and comes home to this loving town that is willing to do anything to help him and his family out."What goes around, comes around", I couldnt stop tearing at the end because its just so loving. I hope future Christmass will go back like this movies examples, where people are just happy to have what they have and realize some are not so lucky, but we must all do our part. Cheesy, I know, but if one person can raise their hand, we all will do our parts in the end. Merry Christmas, everyone! :) 10/10',10,'20 December 2005','0038650');

The violence is to such a degree, the viewer has a problem seating through it.Director Fernando Meirelles has an eye for realism and detail. The most disturbing thing about City of God is the fact that the killers are children playing adult games before they can be children. It is a well known fact that these kids gangs created terror, not only in the favelas where they lived, which was unfortunate, but they mugged, robbed and just plain terrorized the big cities in Brazil. News about street children being shot in the streets of Rio or Sao Paolo were perceived as criminal because of the ages, but one can get a clearer picture in this film by coming to the realization these same children were killing real grown ups and getting away with murder.The only problem I had with this film is with the English subtitles. Sometimes, one doesnt know whos who. To make matters worse, the principal character grows from a young boy into a photographer who looks like a small boy himself. The plots and subplots are somehow hard to follow at times. The great accomplishment for the director is that he never preaches. He shows the world what went on at that particular time. The realism is extended to the way we see in gory details the corpses of the slain gang members. If Hollywood would have presented scenes that are so hard to take as these, many would be criminals would have been able to see first hand what bullets do to human beings: they kill!',8,'7 February 2003','0317248');

	values('ur0035229','This film is a beautiful thing.Okay, perhaps thats cheating. I dont really like responding to people who carp at "Life is Beautiful", mainly because I dont see how they could fail to have the required reactions. How could anyone not find Guido charming? Yes, hes a pathological confabulator, but thats the point. This is the story of someone whose way of life consists of enchanting the world around him with white lies (most of them are white) and manipulative genius. He tries to continue living in the same way as the civilised world around him collapses; arguably, he succeeds, but he ends up paying a heavy price. How could anyone not like this fable?And how could anyone not find both halves of the film - particularly the first, of course - funny? Its the kind of humour where it doesnt matter if you laugh or not; either way, you can still enjoy the wit, and marvel at Guidos folkloric cleverness. And on subsequent viewings it becomes more and more clear how the two halves set each other off perfectly. Toccata and fugue. ...I understand the viewpoint of those who think that Benigni shouldnt have made a comedy about the Holocaust. I can see how Holocaust survivors (and perhaps those close to them) might be genuinely offended. But this doesnt make "Life is Beautiful" a bad film; it simply means, at most, that making it was an impolitic act. Ive heard interviews with Holocaust survivors who thought "Schindlers List" was a similarly impolitic act. (And note that "Schindlers List", however good it may be, is clearly inferior as a work of art.) If anything is wrong, its the act of using the Holocaust as part of the subject matter of ANY work of art. Benignis particular way of handling the subject is as good as any other, provided he succeeds, which he does.',10,'30 January 2001','0118799');

	values('ur3914439','"Star Wars" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isnt too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushings character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.The script is not the greatest achievement in general. Its the usual black-and-white characterization with good vs evil and the characters have no real shades, no facets. This was made up again by the strong work in other departments as its not too memorable what they say and do, but what they look like, especially the non-human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today. I am not saying the characters are written badly. Not at all. But its just other contributions that made them what they are today. Not the script. And while I enjoyed most of the film, I cannot see it as an epic or a cult classic as so many people do to this date. "Star Wars" is bound to rise again with the new film coming out soon and featuring the original cast again. It should be interesting what they make out of it. Until then, feel free to watch the old films like this one, but not too many. The very first Star Wars film here is not a great achievement in terms of story, only in terms of all visual and audible aspects.',6,'2 November 2015','0076759');

	values('ur13134536','Terminator 2 (1991) **** (out of 4) Its not often a sequel is better than the original but thats the case here. Ill go a step further and say this here is one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made. Its funny but I still have vivid memories of watching this on opening night even though I was only eleven-years-old. I remember the buzz going into the movie. I remember who I watched it with and I can even remember what part of the theater I was sitting in. At the time I dont think I fully realized how special the film I was watching was because I only saw it as something extremely cool with ground breaking effects. Today I see the film as a complete masterpiece of film-making even though one might find a few logical issues but then again this is science fiction so the logic could be overlooked anyways. I think it goes without saying but the story is the best thing going on here. The plot is a very simple one: the prevention of Judgment Day so what else do you need? The movie has Arnold Schwarzenegger returning and giving the greatest performance of his career. Linda Hamilton is also back and the way she transformed her character from the first film is pretty remarkable. Edward Furlong makes for a very good John Connor and Robert Patrick is terrific as the villain. The special effects were ground breaking in 1991 and I might say they havent been topped in all the years since. Sure, CGI has come along but they cant hold up to anything in this movie. The liquid metal is pure genius and all the effects are masterfully done. You could pick any single one of them and hold it up as being some of the best ever created. Whereas the first film was extremely dark, this one here allows for the Terminator to have more character development and I think this was a great thing to do. Just as it was great to have Frankensteins monster speak in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, I think its great to show a more humor Terminator. The jokes work perfectly and you cant help but find the ending very touching. No matter which version you watch (I prefer the theatrical) this is a marvelous film that has perfectly stood the test of time and delivers itself as one of the greatest of its type.',0,'29 May 2009','0103064');

This blunder endangers Martys very existence because if his parents dont become an item he will never be born so Marty must move heaven and earth to get his parents on a road to romantic bliss. Meanwhile the younger version of Dr. Emmett Brown must find a way to get his time machine working so he can get Marty back to his own time.Character DevelopmentThe lead character Marty McFly doesnt experience much character development, but he is able to influence others dramatically. Only these developments arent the focus of the story and mostly happen off screenActingOne of the ingredients that are equal to the magic of the story itself is the acting. The characters come to life on screen and carry over to everyday life. This has become an event film that has worked its way from pop culture to film history that has helped mark a decade. There is nothing second rate when it comes to the acting for there are no false moments in any of the casts performances. Though there is a lot of action and racing about, much of what makes repeated viewing of this film possible are the humorous situations that Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) keep getting themselves into and how they react to them. All the lead actors do stellar work and make the trouble that Marty and Emmett get into very believable.OverviewThere are a lot surprises that are both humorous and entertaining. Again the writing is on a level all to its own where one scene snaps perfectly with the next. There never seems to be a moment in time that doesnt connect to a later moment. It is quite brilliant and the transformation from the casts older to younger selves is really amazing. Mix this with the energy of the soundtrack and this has got to be one of best movies of the 80s if not that of all time. Top marks all around.',10,'28 September 2014','0088763');

Maybe im missing something. Also their is a character that apparently is a human but also a dragon and then later turns out to be a river spirit? The f*#k?!?! There is no real deep meaning in the movie as far as I can tell. The main character is fairly static throughout the whole movie and doesnt really grow or learn anything (she is also quite annoying at times) Also Im not totally sure what the target audience is supposed to be here. At times it feels like a family movie sometimes it feels like a creepy horror movie with scary looking characters. I dont really know who this movie is for.

	values('ur2483625','During the Mid Eighties I attended a science fiction convention in Manhattan and the feature attraction there was Anthony Perkins. There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly. Perkins did not really know how to handle the banter, he was in my estimation a serious guy who must have thought he was in a freak show. I asked him about appearing in Friendly Persuasion with Gary Cooper and I told him that that was my favorite role he did. He looked grateful that someone knew he did something besides Norman Bates.But for better or worse, Norman Bates became his career role and its what we remember Anthony Perkins for. He does create an indelible impression on the screen with Alfred Hitchcocks direction as the shy mother fixated man running a flea bag motel in an area where a new super highway has taken all the potential business.Psycho has a simple plot. Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40,000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leighs boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them. Simple enough, but Alfred Hitchcock creates a mood of terror and suspense that lingers long after youve seen the film. My favorite shot of the film is not Leighs legendary shower stabbing, but of Martin Balsam being knocked down and falling down that flight of stairs and then being stabbed to death. The camera work showing Balsam falling backwards is the most terrifying part of Psycho.Though Anthony Perkins did so many other good things, the average cinema fan will tell you 99 out of 100 times that Norman Bates is the role he remembers Perkins for. So Perkins went with the flow.It was repetitious for him, but a treat for fans.',9,'18 October 2006','0054215');

Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie. Yes, I know this review is filled with hyperbole, but I simply cannot remember the last time I was so moved and impressed by a film as I was with the Pianist.

I just dont see a rich family instantly hiring four new employees without thoroughly checking them out first, this would never happen anywhere in the world. The first half was intriguing, and I began to think if they are a family of skillful grifters, then they wouldnt be living in a basement. I began to wonder if these people were family members at all or just a random assortment of con men who got together and pulled off cons, that would have been a neat twist, but no it doesnt go in that direction. Then I thought that the rich family would turn out to be parasites themselves, which would have been intriguing, but it doesnt go in that direction either. For some strange reason theres a violent attack towards the end that doesnt fit in with anything else that happens in the story up to that point, its just random and theres no cognitive flow or context or continuity to any of it, its just a disconnected series of events.

What really stands out for me (aside from the really excellent direction of the action sequences) is the too-brilliant for its own good script. Oldman,Reno, and Portman deliver lines that would seem goofy if spoken by lesser performers. Oldman especially chews the scenery in a way thats both amusing and utterly menacing. I wonder if his Beethoven obsession is a nod to the ultra-violent Alex from A Clockwork Orange?The American version ("The Professional") was the first version I saw. Id originally had no real intention of seeing it because Id read a pretty savage review of it likening it to child pornography. Clearly this particular reviewer had his head firmly planted in his rear. Im surprised he could find room what with that tremendous stick in the way. Anyway, once I finally saw "Leon" for myself - thanks to my cinemaphile grandfather - I observed no such thing. This wasnt smut, it was love. Leon has no interest in Matilda sexually, but loves her as a father would love a daughter.If you have a choice then go for the longer directors cut. You get about 15 minutes more film - and not just filler. These are scenes that truly expand upon the story.My only complaints are about the almost complete under use of the completely underrated Danny Aiello, and Oldmans single dimensional evilness.',8,'24 February 2005','0110413');

	values('ur23966498','The Lion King is by general consensus the greatest Disney film from their glorious renaissance period (1989-1999), and is undoubtedly worthy of such recognition. Notably, it is the highest rated Western animation on IMDbs own Top 250, which while flawed and imprecise is a good indicator of quality.A loose adaption of Shakespeares Hamlet, The Lion King is visually stunning, the peak of hand-drawn animation, with a strong voice cast and a wide selection of memorable tunes. It is a tight ~80 minutes, and one sometimes forgets just how quick the movie moves, yet it does so deftly. The characters are well defined, and the arc of Simbas growth, the core of the film, evolves satisfyingly. One could question whether more time should have been spent on Simbas growth in the middle act (there is incredulous imagery as Simba grows exponentially next to the stasis of Timon and Pumba), but to meander so would ask it to be an entirely different film.While it is not uncommon for a side character or two overshadow the main (see the Genie in Aladdin), Matthew Broderick and Jonathan Taylor Thomas (adult and young Simba respectively) are at risk from nearly all of the phenomenal cast. James Earl Jones is a commanding presence, and Jeremy Irons as Scar steals every scene. The fools of the film, be it Timon & Pumba, the Hyena trio or even Zazu, all provide the levity believably, that would otherwise leave an incredibly sombre film. Nala is powerful, though one must note that she seems at times far more capable than Simba to actually achieve anything. Nevertheless, Simbas coming-of-age arc, while predictable, is enjoyable, helped along by fantastic charisma and choice songs.The fact that the film has spawned a wildly successful musical gives a strong indication of the quality of the music, but what is less said is how beautiful the film is. As The Lion King was being released, works were already moving away from hand-drawn animation, with Toy Story released a year later. And The Lion King might be the peak of hand-drawn, with an enormous palate of creativity and variety. The opening vista for Circle of Life, the bursts of colour in Cant wait to be King and the sombre tone of Be Prepared all are gorgeous. Yet, special mention must go to the Stampede scene, one of the finest scenes of animation ever.One thing Ive developed from multiple viewings is how Timon and Pumba might be the weakest part of the movie. First, their life lessons are essentially reversed by Rafiki. Certainly they are qualified to the point of being narratively sidelined. They feel contrived and even a detraction from the meat of the movie. Their role is the fast food portion of the film- the quick fix over more meatier bits of the film. The entertainment provided is enjoyable regardless, and is essential to round off the movie as Disney.The Lion King is endlessly re-watchable, catchy, fun, while remaining a fantastic piece of cinema and an invaluable part of the Disney canon.

Ailing Marcus Aurelius ( Richard Harris) would like his confident and favorite to take over empire , but the events go wrong . Mean heir Comoduss (Joaquin Phoenix) vices arise from poor parental care as he takes power. When the Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperors corrupt son , the insecure Commodus feels powerful . Having ensured father dies in his arms , the new emperor exerts his killer fury . Maximus , then comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge .He wont swear loyalty and gets a chance to redeem himself .Father of a murdered son , husband to a murdered wife and I shall have my revenge in this life or the next .This bloody good movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , thrills ,fundamental emotions , fortright spectacle ,fierce combats including scud catapults , and is pretty entertaining . The film results to be a special remake to Â¨Fall of Roman EmpireÂ¨ directed by Antony Mann with Stephen Boyd , Sofia Loren and Christopher Plummer as Commodus , though is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action . Before directing Â¨Robin Hood , Kingdom of heavenÂ¨ films , director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes . Great performances abound , as stalwart Russell Crowe playing an enslaved ex-general who bent on vengeance , he is very fine ; in addition , vacilating empress Connie Nielsen is memorable and attractive , she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate woman . Special mention to gladiator owner magnetically performed by Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix as evil and crazed emperor in a sensationalistic interpretation . Marvelous relationship between Maximus-Russel Crowe and an African slave-Dijimon Honsou , the deep bond lends a P.C. historicity. Ample support cast formed by notorious British secondaries as David Hemmings David Schofield , John Schrapnel and endearing Derek Jacobi . There are great action sequences including the battle against Barbarians and the final confrontation in arena at the climax of the film. Impeccable but sometimes dark cinematography by John Mathieson . Movie is shot on natural sets and interior scenarios with impressive production design by Arthur Max , but also excessive use of computer generator images . Magnificent and sensible musical score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard , including wonderful songs .I found it fun , well-acted , in Peplum tradition and fast-paced.The motion picture packed with pomp and pageantry is lavishly produced by the prestigious Douglas Wick and David Franzoni , also screenwriter ; being glamorously directed by Ridley Scott , at his best and as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film Â¨Someone to watch over meÂ¨ and others as Â¨Blade runnerÂ¨, Â¨Black rainÂ¨ , Â¨LegendÂ¨ in which his visual style is impressive . The picture belongs to his speciality ,the historical genre , as Â¨Robin HoodÂ¨ , Â¨Kingdom of heavenÂ¨ , Â¨DuelistsÂ¨ and Â¨Black Hawk downÂ¨ . Rating : Above average .

Its intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes Ive ever seen.

Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogates Verbal that explains what happened to Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and him in the vessel. Six weeks ago, they met each other at the line-up in the police station and decide to team-up for a heist under the command of the former corrupt cop Keaton. After delivering the jewels to the fence Redfoot (Peter Greene), they are hired for another heist and then the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches to them and tell that the notorious Hungarian gangster Keyser SÃ¶ze had offered them to go to the ship to destroy the cocaine they are transporting. They go to the ship and do not find any drug, and Keyser SÃ¶ze killed each one of them. Who is Keyser SÃ¶ze?Twenty-two years after the releasing date, "The Usual Suspects" is still a great film that has not aged. The impact reduces a little if the viewer still recalls who Keyser SÃ¶ze is, but the film is still one of the best of the genre. Kevin Spacey was not well-known and Bryan Singer was in the beginning of his career, but the direction and performances are top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written in the cinema history for a mystery film and the result is a fantastic movie.

I have not been so captured and entertained in a long time. I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing, and with the impact of the human message about obsession, competition and retribution carried to the extreme. One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time.Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine all contributed stunning, emotional performances. Rebecca Hall, who played Sarah to Bales Alfred Borden, turned in a highly charged performance as well, making Scarlett Johanssons Olivia flat in comparison. And although some people thought the plot line a bit tedious, I found it to be refreshingly complex and engaging, while not being so complex as to lose you. If you cant follow this one, youve been watching television too long. And who cares if the illusions are mundane or scientifically unbelievable? Isnt that what both movies and illusions ask us to do? To suspend disbelief? Meantime, theres a message in its madness. Hello.The film is visually moody and evocative, easily transporting you into the time period. What more could you ask for? A film is a visual medium and this one is a visual ten. The acting is superb as well as the plot. It keeps you interested; it keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end.It asks you, what is one willing to sacrifice for the "prestige?"I think this ones an Oscar definite.',10,'21 October 2006','0482571');

	values('ur34049683','From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Ricks by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. Its early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think its cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasnt until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late 30s and early 40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who werent able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petains puppet government. Even the great line near the end, I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song "As Time Goes By" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldnt have that theme. The theme of Sams piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Ricks CafÃ©. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesnt even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didnt care if its pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme "As Time Goes By" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. Its doesnt bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly dont see how the line Round up the usual suspect is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didnt like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there werent any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Dont see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The films lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you dont get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.',9,'3 August 2013','0034583');

Chaplin combined his silent film skills with creative use of sound effects and music, and added a wide variety of interesting and entertaining settings, to create a film that is very pleasing to watch. Chaplins own fine acting is complemented by a delightful and charming performance by Paulette Goddard. And the story itself, filled with twists and turns, is a timeless commentary on "modern" life, much of which is applicable to any era.Charlies "Tramp" character joins up in this one with a lively, orphaned gamin (Goddard) to help each other through a lengthy series of setbacks and triumphs that reflect the stresses of fast-paced modern life. Most of their adventures are hilarious, but many also contain serious social commentary that is still just as relevant in any age. Chaplin and Goddard make a delightful pair who win the complete sympathy of the viewer in their fight for survival.The movie has one great scene after another, from some wild sequences in a steel factory, to a set of sometimes breath-taking antics in a deserted department store, to the incomparable climactic sequence in a cafe, and many others in between. The settings are done with great care and wit, and the action makes full use of the props and possibilities at hand.This is a wonderful movie that anyone who likes vintage cinema will enjoy. Even those who are thoroughly jaded by the excesses of modern cinema should at least give "Modern Times" a try. This is one of the great masterpieces of Chaplins or any other era.',0,'21 June 2001','0027977');

It is beautifully shot, perfectly cast, ambitious, erotic, humorous and wonderfully scored by Leones regular composer Ennio Morricone, whose haunting melodies are just as important as the widely separated dialog occurring on the action..The film opens with an extreme close-ups of Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Lionel Stander waiting at a station for Charles Bronson... Henry Fonda has sent them to kill him...The railroad wants a property for its water well belonging to the newly widowed Claudia Cardinale, a fancy lady from New Orleans who just arrived in Flagstone and learns about the tragedy... We would come to understand, much later, Claudia Cardinales role as the bearer of water, life, and continuity to the civilization of the New West...Fonda, a despicable hired gun, kills her husband and orders, without a twinge of guilt, the slaughter of the entire family, innocents women and children...Henry Fonda, in a chilling performance, plays the cold-blooded murderer, the most vicious villain in Westerns history to ever ride the big country... the blue ice-eyed child killer, gunning down a 9-year old boy...Bronson as The Man is like Clint Eastwood The Man With No Name, with only one thing in common: they are the most ruthless heroes in Westerns history sharing the same character in their quality not to say much in their need of emotions, in their fast draw, in their disinterest in women, in their air of mystery and in their macabre sense of humor...Their differences are also very clear: The Man With No Name has no past whatsoever, and The Man is motivated by revenge to settle an old personal score... Claudia Cardinale plays Jill, the well-proportioned, husky-voiced beauty, the lady, the businesswoman, the maker of coffee involved with Fonda in an incredible perverse erotic sequence...The blood, the violence, the humor, the several gunfights and the final showdown have been constants in Leones Westerns since "A Fistful of Dollars"...The highlights of his movie are so many: Leones overwhelming shot when he raises his camera over the Flagstone train station office revealing the sprawling town; when he replaces a shot of a smoking gun with a shot of a smoking train; when he uses close-ups instead of dialog to reveal what a character is thinking; and the striking use of his extreme close-up in the final shootout... Leone builds up tension by slowly circling his two characters, focusing with his camera on their eyes, hands and guns while the level of the music is raised to evoke the action... Leones film is a brave epic Western, extremely violent, immensely powerful... Its above all fable and fantasy, as the desire for revenge is childish and fruitless... It is the essence of a great filmmaker...',9,'29 January 2000','0064116');

Although universally considered as one of the top three (or maybe top five) best thrillers that Alfred Hitchcock made in his lengthy and undeniably brilliant career, I personally feel that "Rear Window" is the most overrated movie of all times and I sincerely cant fathom why its such a cinematic landmark. I reckon that the basic plot idea is utmost intriguing and that its rather inventive how the cameras film literally everything from within the same secluded living room location, but that about sums up all the films strengths. The narcistic photographer L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) sits immobilized in his apartment, bound to both a wheelchair and a humongous plaster cast around his leg ever since he took too much risk during a photo shoot on a racetrack. Purely out of boredom, he begins to watch all his neighbors across the little cement garden. The watching quickly turns into observing with binoculars and then into spying with his most professional & strongest photo lenses. He then thinks he witnesses a middle-aged man murdering his wife in cold blood, but a befriended police inspector, his lovely girlfriend and even his nosy housekeeper have trouble believing him. I was particularly annoyed by the behavior and ignorance of the protagonist. Jeff is supposed to be an intelligent person, so he must understand or at least respect that the police cant just go invading someones private property and interrogate them about a possibly felony for which there isnt any evidence. The entire film evidently revolves on L.B. Jefferies arrogant persona, and of course it doesnt help that I never really liked the actor James Stewart. I can appreciate him when his characters arent omnipresent, like in Hitchcocks "Rope" for example, but here he was rapidly getting on my nerves. The other characters, including Grace Kelly who never looked prettier, are downgraded to mere extras. I am also aware that practically every review praises that the powerful impact of "Rear Window" lies in the fact that its a statement on the human towards voyeurism and blah blah, but to me a film has to be entertaining and plausible first and foremost. "Read Window" along with "Vertigo" and "The Man Who Knew Too Much" made me realize that cant get into Hitchs espionage or wrong-man-condemned thrillers, and that I find his more polished thrillers extremely boring, unrealistic and overrated. Im primarily a horror fanatic, and thus love the nasty Hitchcock films the most, like "Psycho", "Shadow of a Doubt", "Rope" and "Frenzy".',4,'7 February 2018','0047396');

Its a love story about a little Italian town and its theatre: the Cinema Paradiso. And like the films they watch the audience themselves all have their own stories to tell. It all centres around Alfredos movie theatre and his raising of Salvatore Toto Di Vita through the magic of movies via 35mm-cinema projection.Its a coming-of-age story about cinemas wisdom and charm rather than the cynicism of the film industry: its got a heart-warning vibe to it throughout its two-hour+ runtime (depending on whether youve seen the theatrical, or the near-three-hour extended, cut of the movie) and its one any self-professed cinephile MUST watch!Its an example of European cinema thats artistically expressive and surprisingly accessible to more mainstream audiences.

	values('ur0819382','Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films, this is one of the best, along with "The Gold Rush" and "Modern Times." Two stories are woven together. One is Charlies on-again off-again friendship with a wealthy drunk. The guy has a case of multiple personality. When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts. When hes sober he doesnt recognize Charlie at all.The second story involves a pretty, blind flower girl who, given certain distances, angles, and lighting, resembles Uma Thurman. Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballs.Charlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy, hes sober and wont support Charlies story. Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail. When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel, broke and bitter, he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands. The happy ending.Theres sentimentality in the story of course. There often is in Chaplins later films. But, as usual, its somehow tempered. Here, its undercut by irony.When Charlie meets the wealthy toff, the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him. He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope. Hes about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes, gives him a pep talk, and changes his mind. His spirit revived, the rich guy spread his arms to the sky, dropping the boulder that falls on Charlies foot.And when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl, shes enthralled by his gentleness. Unseen by her, the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail. Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills. Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain, himself enraptured. Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlies face. Well, its not the blind Mr. Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W. C. Fields general store, but what is? A note. There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film, not counting the Dempsey-Tunney debacle, but I dont think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed here.Its hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this.

It contains two new and important scenes, and one of them, the "french" episode, adds a whole new touch to a classic movie, WITHOUT breaking the atmosphere or disturbing the overall picture. I remember as I saw the Redux for the first time, that my whole understanding of the war in Vietnam changed, and how I had to go to the library and get an update on a few things. Also it is interesting that Coppola chose the year 2000 for the longer Redux. My guess is that he feels that the movie is as important today as it was back in 1979. He even went to the trouble of making an excellent piece of art even better, in order to actually make all the old fans see the new stuff, and to present a whole new generation with a very controversial and strong comment on one of the most bloody wars in recorded history. The movie is thought-provoking indeed, but also it has a visually very beautifully composed screenplay. Capturing the madness and chaos of war the storyline is also filled with more or less obvious metaphors and philosophical or existential riddles. A friend of mine called it "the most philosophical of all movies" - perhaps an overstatement - in my opinion it is just a very good film about war and the politics of war. But I can see that there is plenty for everyone here. What Im saying is that its one of those movies that you are likely to hear distinctly different opinions about, and you are most probably going to think again and again about it. Ive seen the Redux 5, 6 or 7 times, and it is always a puzzling experience. Highly recommended.',10,'2 September 2005','0078788');

George Lucas had just created and launched two sci-fi classics with the first two chapters of the "Star Wars" saga while Spielberg was also already considered one of the most promising directors in Hollywood having effect astonishing successes with "Jaws (1975)" and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) ".Classic recipe for matinees adored by George Lucas, the work of screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan is one of the most consistent doing an excellent job of keeping to the basics: virtually all characters in The Raiders of the Lost Ark are based on archetypes, but none of them lack personality. Indy himself is one of the most famous characters in American cinema, fitting the profile of the classic action hero, but with several peculiarities that make him special, from his acid sense of humor, his clumsy way to achieve a goal and also his intelligence. All villains are purposefully shallow and Manichean, with Nazism incorporating all the evil on Earth in a cartoonish way, but that never sounds strange in this proposal.In "Raiders of the Lost Ark", Spielberg makes his first openly action movie, even though "Duel", "Jaws" and "1941" had their setpieces there, here is a popcorn adventure from start to finish, and this is a category in which the filmmaker would become an expert. The opening scene alone is a lesson in how to introduce a character and his universe, with Spielbergs camera keeping a mystery about Indys identity - Douglas Slocombes photograph skillfully covers Fords face with shadows - but building your personality and your iconic figure through frames that portray your courage and demonstrate your skills; see the closed planes of the hat, the leather jacket and the whip on the long belt before the protagonist draws it against an attacker. It is an aesthetic care and well elaborated by the filmmakers camera game, which is maintained throughout the films other numerous action sequences. Between shootings in bars, races to stop a truck and a fist fight on an airstrip, what most charm the project is the ability of the filmmaker to create an atmosphere of tension that embarks on a frantic and good-natured adventure. is one of the great strengths of the feature, guaranteeing the film never to lose its rhythm, while the characters go over obstacle after obstacle, as in a real board game. Spielbergs ability to command the action is present in the most "naive" scenes, such as the snake pit or the fight in the Nazi plane, even in the most elaborate ones, such as the chase of trucks involving Jones and several soldiers.Classic backstage story, it was Harrison Fords suggestion that Indy, when faced by a skilled swordsman in the Cairo market, simply shoot his opponent instead of starting an elaborate fight with his whip - as the script originally said. A sensational improvisation that came out of the mere fact that Ford and several members of the team were sick because of the heat and the local food, and that perfectly ended up defining one of Indys personality traits. Throughout two other action scenes, the hero "asks" an opponent to wait while he prepares to return to the fight, and casually answers one of his colleagues who asks him what his plan is: "I dont know, I invent on the way". Priceless phrases and actions, and that only Harrison Ford would be able to deliver with such charisma and naturalness, in what is definitely the most striking role of his remarkable career. Ford is loose, unlike what he commonly complained of Han Solo here he can show some more facets and not a predominant one as is the extremely obvious scoundrel antihero. He is incredulous that the journey he will take will result in something really in the encounter with something divine in fact, in addition to being able to represent well the teacher for whom his students sigh, besides of course to reproduce the clichÃ© of forbidden love for someone of the past, In this case, Marion, the strong and feminine character of Karen Allen, a woman who is clearly not a full-time damsel in distress.With special care for the action, what is also striking is how Spielberg maintains his same technical eye for the most expository scenes. For example, the scene where Indy and Brody (Denholm Elliott) are approached by government officials, and the archaeologist explains the Ark of the Covenant myth to them, Spielberg films much of the dialogue in an open plan with all four characters there, well-disposed through a mise en scÃ¨ne that puts the agents - and the spectator - in a classroom, where Indy even uses the blackboard to present some concepts that will become important in the future; an exhibition that does not sound forced, after all the protagonist is in fact a teacher. We also see Spielbergs brand developing, where the filmmaker works on long shots that always change the characters positions and the graceful movement of the camera, giving the strong impression that a cut has happened, but remaining in the same shot. Iconography is also a factor that Spielberg and Slocombe masterfully explore, as in the scene where Indy visits Marion in her bar, casting a giant shadow on the girl, but being Marion a fearless woman - and the most memorable one in the archaeologists gallery - she is very capable of opposing the presence of Indy, and the shadow soon fades over the course of the conversation.The master of Star Wars songs, conductor John Williams had already been working with Spielberg since "Jaws", and not tired of delivering memorable themes, he reaches one of the culminations of his career with the Indiana Jones musical piece. It is a cheerful, adventurous and even flashy theme, which summarizes all the feelings and themes of the franchise, as well as offering emotionally demarcated tracks, such as the love theme with Marion and the most oppressive and heavy orchestra to portray the Nazis. Another work of genius, for a change.Being an example of the 80s, and literally beginning the decade, the overwhelming majority of the special effects of Hunters are done in a practical way, being done in the studio, unlike the digital effects so common today. It is very good that Spielberg did not like his friend George Lucas who adapted the effects of Star Wars for the "current times" which would be to deny the nature of the film and the time in which it was made. The snake scene was made with real snakes (and that scene with a cobra was filmed with a cobra between a glass panel and the actor. The giant ball at the beginning is actually a giant ball, and the scene where Indiana Jones is dragged by a car was filmed that way, with some stuntmen obviously, but Harrison Ford himself was dragged by the car at one point. We have rubber dolls and animatronics to serve as the dead henchmen, while the need for a more supernatural practically takes the film on a path of trash terror. Anyone who watched the film as a child is forever scarred by the images of Nazis having their faces twisted, exploded and melted when the Ark demonstrates the magnitude and horror of its power, and Spielberg and his team have fun here. Okay, the matte paintings and projections of the "spirits" of the Ark are images that today appear considerably dated, but still have an impact, as well as the wonderful eighth of the Nazi Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) literally melting before our eyes.One of the great films of Spielbergs career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time. The film, despite being a big blockbuster, still has personal traits of the director who is Jewish, so dont think that the Nazis are villains by chance. Spielberg prints in CaÃ§adores gains a strong and constant critical sub-text that enriches the cinematographic experience, combining narrative lightness with very strong "strikes" against the most murderous regime of the 20th century. It is almost like a form of indoctrination in which a certain political position was instilled in the subconscious without our realizing it."Raiders of the Lost Ark" borders on perfection, as it shows that the academic or scientific search can evidently solve some mysteries, while so many others are apparently instituted to be solved with time and investigations that will last for the lives and generations of many scholars, and this feeling gains even more strength with the scene that precedes the credits, where you see a shed with numerous artifacts kept, all waiting to star in one or more adventures of Indiana and yours.With all these elements well balanced - including a predilection for fantasy - "The Raiders of the Lost Ark" became one of the biggest commercial successes in cinema history, competing for eight Oscars and taking four, starting a millionaire franchise and also generating several imitations. We witnessed a perfect adventure film here, being one of the most dignified and perfect examples that the genre has ever seen. Indiana Jones is already born an iconic figure, thanks to the good ideas of George Lucas and the technical virtuosity of Steven Spielberg, who delivers his first great action film in a fun and intelligent way, using the nostalgia of a very specific period to create something completely new.',8,'27 June 2020','0082971');

	values('ur13134536','Django Unchained (2012) **** (out of 4)Quentin Tarantino returns to full glory in this violent homage to the various Spaghetti Westerns that he grew up watching. Former slave Django (Jamie Foxx) is bought by bounty hunter Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and in exchange for his help in tracking down three wanted brothers, Schultz promises to give him his freedom. Things then change when Django decides to go find his wife (Kerry Washington) who is being held by the notorious Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). I was one of the few who didnt care too much about Tarantinos previous film but DJANGO UNCHAINED has him returning to full glory. This film is funny, intense, violent, at times shocking but most important is that its flat-out great entertainment from start to finish. If one is easily offended then theres a lot here to get upset about but it seems people often forget that Tarantino makes exploitation movies, which means he takes a serious subject and exploits it for entertainment. All sorts of violent sub-genres came up during the 70s glory days of exploitation and I think mixing the Spaghetti Western with a slave story works on many levels. The biggest being that the film manages to shock you but you also hate whats going on so much that you cant help but get behind Django and his cause. Foxx really did a remarkable job here and perfectly captured those gunslingers who said very little but did their talking with a gun. Waltz and his comic timing are downright terrific and he really adds a perfect balance to what Foxx does. DiCaprio is also excellent in the role of the sadistic Southern gentleman and Im sure Oscar-time will be friendly. Don Johnson also does a great job with his small but flashy role and the debate on the masks is a brilliant example of comedy. The film really does a remarkable job at being a Tarantino film. Meaning that everything a fan has come to expect from one of his movies is on full display and perfectly executed. The music score is fabulous, the cinematography highly impressive and the costumes and settings really make you feel as if youre in the actual period that the film is set. DJANGO UNCHAINED isnt going to be for everyone but then again, what exploitation film is? The film is very dark, very bloody but oh so funny. It works on all levels including a terrific adventure picture with a bloody good revenge tale.',9,'27 December 2012','1853728');

	values('ur0622275','I remember when this came out it got quite a lot of critical acclaim. Of course it never made it to a cinema near me and so when it came up in the TV listings it became a must see for me. Im really glad I saw it, its somewhat different to what I was expecting (in a good way). I know there are a few out there that are afraid of subtitles, so I should tell you that yes, its in German with subtitles. For me, this isnt a problem, but with a long film (as this is), I find I sometimes have to take a break to rest the brain for a few minutes. I found it to be a really engaging drama that has some truly powerful scenes and some great performances. Heres a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.It is East Germany in 1984, five years before the Berlin wall would fall. The East German people are constantly watched by the secret police, The Stasi. Anyone deemed to have strayed from the party line was arrested and interrogated. They could even end up in jail. When playwright, Georg Dreyman comes under the spotlight of the Stasi, at the behest of party official, Minister Bruno Hempf, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is assigned the case. Dreymans apartment is bugged and Wiesler begins to listen to the comings and goings in the flat. Dreyman lives with his girlfriend, actress, Christa-Maria Sieland, who has a big part to play in the events that unfold. As time goes by, Wiesler begins to empathise with those hes listening to. He realises that not everything has to be reported, to the extent that he even scales down the operation so he alone reports on the couple. He uses this position to protect them when Dreyman begins to do things the party really wouldnt like. I will leave my summary here so as not to be subjected to a 48 hour interrogation by them Spoiler Police.This is a very well made film, although I did find the surroundings very stark, but then again, I guess thats just realism. Great performances all round, particularly from Ulrich MÃ¼he who played the rather serious Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler with great dignity. I thought Sebastian Koch as Georg Dreyman and Martina Gedeck as Christa-Maria Sieland were both superb. Ulrich Tukur did a good job as Wieslers boss, Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz, as did Thomas Thieme as the loathsome Minister Bruno Hempf.I was surprised how much emotion was brought out both in, and by, this film. In the end it becomes a very heart-warming story. The beginning, on the other hand, I found really hard to follow, but once it settled down it was much easier. It has a slow, deliberate pace, but I didnt find it a chore to watch. I did find it was a little long though, but the extra scenes at the end are a real pay-off. So, if youre not scared of subtitles, and you can spare 137 minutes, then this one comes highly RECOMMENDED.My Score: 8.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 93,806 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 93/100 (based on 150 reviews counted when this review was written).',9,'14 August 2011','0405094');

Dax (Kirk Douglas) finds himself trying to defend his accused men of cowardice in face of the enemy. All awile it was in fact his superior officer who threatened to fire on his own man just to take over a hill. A lost cost from the start.Whats interesting about this film, aside of showing a man facing the system to go and defend his men, is also the hidden message and criticism over war and how generals take drastic decisions, ending up killing thousands of their own. The criticism comes to the smallest details of dialogue.Stanley Kubricks way of telling the stupidity of war and its affects on the military system is a genuine way of his, such the same with Dr. Strangelove.',8,'30 October 2022','0050825');

	values('ur1425686','Released in 1940, "The Great Dictator" was the first Hollywood film that denounced Hitler directly (albeit in the guise of Adenoid Hynkel), took a virulent stand against fascism, and directly addressed Anti-Semitism. Over-long, at times heavy-handed, it still has many wonderful sequences, including the famous dance with the globe, and all the scenes of Chaplin with Jack Oakie, each trying to out-do the other and prove his superiority.One criticism that seems to occasionally rear its head is the implication that Chaplins pre-World War II anti-fascism was somehow wrong-headed. The atrocities of the Holocaust werent fully known to the world yet, so Chaplins anti-Hitler diatribe is, in the minds of some, misguided. After the war this mindset would result in the debacle of the blacklist, when Chaplin, among others, were branded "pre-mature anti-fascists." In other words, it wasnt politically acceptable to be against Nazism until war broke out with the U.S. Hard to believe anyone could still see things that way now, but some do.The film industry of the 1930s wanted no part of international politics, no matter how blatant the brutality of a given regime. Profits were at stake. It was little goyisha Charley Chaplin, playing a Jewish barber, who took a public stand.While "The Great Dictator" may not among Chaplins finest films, it may, historically, be his finest hour.',0,'5 June 2002','0032553');

But I cannot imagine it being better than this one. And while I have not read the book King wrote (and therefor cannot tell you the differences of how you should feel about King not liking it), I do like this movie very much.Saying there is attention to detail would be one major understatement. There is a documentary who interprets all the details of the film and goes quite far out at times, but more on that elsewhere. The movie at hand has powerhouse performances. Watching some behind the scenes footage, gives you quite the feeling of what went on.Some may have had issues with the way Kubrick went on to do things, the amount of takes he demanded, the way he behaved allegedly and much more. But the results on the screen speak for themselves. You may not like horror movies and yet still find something here. You also may like horror movies and think this isnt a horror movie at all. Its not easy, but he knows what hes doing and he plays the viewer like a fidel - relax and let it happen',10,'23 November 2019','0081505');

The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with "Avengers: Infinity War" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive. With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of "Captain America: Civil War" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing. Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence. What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other. There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with "Avengers: Age of Ultron" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film. I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene. Believe the hype, "Avengers: Infinity War" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be. 5 stars out of 5',10,'24 April 2018','4154756');

It is an adrenaline filled ride filled with creepy locations, intense action, thrills, much circumstantial humor and one-liners that will never grow old (mostly thanks to Bill Paxton). It is, unapologetically, a mans movie, filled with everything except nudity (which it did not need).All movies in the Alien series have a claustrophobic feel to them, and involve a relatively small cast of players. Aliens is no exception and really capitalizes on the fear potential of the locale. Cameron is not exactly known for injecting horror into his films, but provides enough here to satisfy.The characters are very well cast and the actors have great chemistry. I especially grooved to the fact that, even though the soldiers are supposed to be tough marines, not all of them were completely gung-ho about their adventures. In fact, a few were downright cowardly and indecisive in the face of combat - something Im certain would happen to many in such a situation. Bill Paxton stole the show as the wisecracking space marine. With all the likable characters involved, the stakes were very high. When they start dropping, we feel the loss.Movies like this just dont come around very often. The pacing is very tight, even when the action is absent. The characters and situations are interesting enough - when the action hits, it just serves to suck us in deeper. I have nothing bad to say about Aliens. It is simply an awesome movie with a well deserved reputation for being such. See for yourself.',10,'14 January 2008','0090605');

And it shows: the special effects give me headaches, because they are so clumsily done. And there are lots of those clumsy effects. But it is a comedy, so who cares? Most of the jokes are completely silly, which sometimes irritates me a bit. But hey, it is a comedy, so who cares if it is completely silly now and then. The speed of this story might be way to slow for some viewers, but acting is really great and hilarious, so that evens things out a lot, for me personally.The good: Despite all of these minor flaws that are mentioned above, "Dr Strangelove" is still an impressive movie about the total madness of nuclear war. However silly this comedy might be, it has got a serious message for all us viewers: a nuclear war will mean the end of all of us. There are no winners, only losers in a nuclear war, however hard some try to convince us folks of the opposite. This movie is about all those people who think that nuclear war can be good IF we strike first. Because IF WE DONT have nuclear powers, THEY will have them. These twisted paranoid ideas could mean the end of the world as we know it and director Stanley Kubrick made a great classic comedy about it.When watching this classic movie, one must not forget that the director made this movie in an era in which the americans came close to nuclear war with the russians during the "bay of pigs" conflict in Cuba during the sixties. However silly this movie might be, it has got a very serious message about the dangers of nuclear power. THAT particular message is what makes "Dr. Strangelove" a timeless classic.',9,'15 December 2018','0057012');

The kid from "3rd Rock From The Sun" is mind-blowingly miscast as the deuteragonist, the cat lady has all the world-weary sex appeal of a fatal fishing accident, and Nolans apparent desire to deify and then blow every cop in sight is downright sickening.The mask "holds the pain in?" What kind of idiocy are we expected to swallow? This was not just poorly written, but actually asinine, and "asinine" is not a word I use lightly, much like "gonorrhea" or "complete transmission rebuild." Plot holes and contrivances abound, so numerous I shant trouble with them except to say that conventional wisdom tells us that the US has about a three-day supply of food on hand if the supply chain were interrupted, but Gotham has enough for three months without outside help, which Bane explicitly forbade? Including enough to feed thousands of cops trapped underground, presumably so theyll be on hand for the assault on Mordor at the end of the film? And all this is handwaved away by Detective Exposition telling another character that "theyre getting food and water." Based on the fit and energetic fellows who show up at said assault, they ate pretty good down there. Lets say ninety days underground at three meals a day for 4000 guys (a woefully small number-- the real NYPD has over 34000 uniforms). Thats over a million meals! Howd that work again? Even if they only got one MRE a day, thats over 350000 meals. In a city of about a million and a half (again assuming parity with Manhattan), thats a lotta food. Whered they get it? I dont ask (or expect) much of films, honestly, but I do insist on crap making sense.To sum up, boring, lifeless, silly, and pretentious. The socialist class-warfare claptrap the cat lady kept spouting didnt help, either. Badly written, mostly badly acted, trite, and conventional. Everything wrong with Hollywood in a 200-million-dollar nutshell. Overblown drivel masquerading as deep social commentary.Dreck.',1,'7 August 2012','1345836');

Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a characters identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, its a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. Its a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, its a fait accompli.

I havent seen "Death Proof" but I think Ive seen all the other ones hes directed and this is definitely the worst. In fact his films have been getting worse all the time and the last respectable thing he did was "Jackie Brown" as far as Im concerned. Im pretty much through with him. His credit is totally gone with me. As far as I can tell he makes movies to feed the fantasies of 14 year old boys. It seems like his early movies were fun and different, even if they used a lot of stuff from older movies they put it together in a different way. But this movie and "Kill Bill", these are just stupid movies to me. Pornography of violence basically.Theres something to be said for the old exploitation movies. Im not entirely ignorant on this subject. He used a lot of ideas from the B-crime movies of the 50s with "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs", and then he did I guess his version of "blaxpoloitation" with "Jackie Brown." But the thing is, that movie was made with respect to black people. Its not even really a blaxploitation movie at all, just a decent modern caper movie that uses music from the 70s movies. But with this "Inglorious Basterds" thing, its really like hes trying to make his own "Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS" movie. But hes trying to have his cake by making it "Ilsa, She Wolf of the Jewish resistance." And ultimately he just presents this sad tableau where every character and every scene is dehumanized and dehumanizing. If he had actually wanted to make a movie that would have entertained Hitler, he couldnt have done better.I want to give this movie points for being different, but how can you reward somebody just for being worse than others, for daring to go further into violence for the sake of violence and justifying it with some lame-arse stuff like "oh theyre all Nazis, who cares what happens to Nazis?" Its still dehumanizing in my opinion, it debases us to be encouraged to fantasize about committing this kind of violence to anyone. Movies like this are what makes me scared for the future of America, which I love dearly. Dont try to say that the "Basterds" are presented in some kind of negative light, or the film is a parody of American Exceptionalism. Thats just an excuse that Tarantino built into the film with a few throw-away lines like "watching the Jew Bear bash a Nazi is the closest thing we get to a movie." Just to be self conscious about using violence and hate as a cinematic value (like the most base and disgusting exploitation films Tarantino apparently adores in a different way than I ever could) is not to justify it, not even in an aesthetic sense.',2,'28 June 2010','0361748');

The animation is still very expressive at capturing character, tone and making a believable world unto itself. Pixar would go on to create more polished films but this one has all the hallmarks of the company. The story is enjoyable for children and if parents squint they can see a metaphor in employment turnover. (Not to mention the cultural transition from westerns to sci-fi, or the meta irony of 2d cell animation being supplanted by CGI). The film is equal parts charming, funny and exciting. It even tugs at the heartstrings not matter how cynical you are. It is far from Pixars best but it holds its own in the pantheon of animated films.',9,'28 December 2020','0114709');

Its a serious question.Ill grant the soundtrack is fine - probably the last effective work by the now increasingly insufferable James Horner.Aside for that, Braveheart belongs with Gladiator and Titanic to the Hall of Fame of "Bafflingly popular, but nothing special" pseudo-historical movies (and Id argue its the weakest among those three).So, why is this great? Characters? Set-pieces? The human drama is laughable. Director Mel Gibson and writer Randall Wallace never met a clichÃ© they didnt like. The true historical events would be interesting enough without spicing them up with nonsense; see the fictional romance between Wallace and princess Isabella, something so mawkish it would make a soap-opera writer blush with shame (note that the real Isabella was about ten years old when Wallace died).Characters are painted in broad strokes: Wallace = flawless hero, giving Gibson the chance to play the umpteenth messianic figure of his career; Edward Longshanks = Satan, with Patrick McGoohan having a blast as the moustache-twirling villain; Isabella = romantic princess yearning for real love, so lovely Marceau can make puppy eyes at Gibson and have ludicrous "Oooh, he looks so hot!" chats with her handmaiden. The only one who is given some depth is Robert Bruce, allowing Angus Macfayden to walk away with the movie. Other low points include the racism inherent in making every British character a sneering monster and the odiously homophobic portrayal of Edward II - who was just a little boy at the time - as an effete, mean-spirited buffoon (think how the murder of his lover is played for laughs!). Battle scenes, while featuring a certain visceral intensity, are not great. There is no sense of complex tactics or spatial relationships; Gibsons notion of medieval warfare seems to be "people running and screaming". Incidentally, swords are MELEE WEAPONS. They cannot be thrown at a great distance with a whirling sound to impale an enemy far away... unless you are in some cheap sword and sorcery flick.The funniest thing about these battles, though, has to be our heroic Scots using both face paint (which was a Celtic practice hundred of years BEFORE) and kilts (invented much LATER). Its the equivalent of a WWII movie with soldiers carrying both medieval armors and iPods. However, while ridiculous, this is a non-issue compared to clichÃ©s and paper-thin characters.Still, this is per se a watchable flick - just dont try to sell it as the next Lawrence of Arabia. 6/10',6,'12 September 2008','0112573');

It is a small submarine, and their individual lives are melded into the claustrophobic constricted world in which they live. Every action has a reaction. Everything is done with the knowledge that a single slip up will lead to their destruction. They face a series of death defying maneuvers and escapes, losing a little of themselves whenever they survive. The war is the enemy, and these men would have meant nothing to those in power. As with most wars, we redefine the value of human life and put others ahead of the common man. The terror of each moment, each challenge, is magnified. They probably dont know what it is for except someone has told them it is important.I will not spoil the conclusion, but I will say that it is apt and arbitrary, just as their lives have been.

I have no problem with movies like Back to the Future or Hot Tub Time Machine that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, Dr Strange can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isnt the stupidest thing Ive ever seen in a movie I dont know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with Iron Man simply pulling the glove off Thanos - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? Thanos just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who dont have a comedy background delivered them very poorly.

However, in seeking the domain of the gods he walks into the middle of a three-way battle between the samurai, who want Iron Towns iron deposits; Lady Eboshi who rules Iron Town and is stripping the forest of its trees to mine it out; and finally the animals and spirits of the forest who must defend their homes, fighting for them is the human Mononoke, a young woman raised by the wolves.It is hard to top Spirited Away, and it is maybe unfair of me to come to this film after I had seen that. This film cannot match the sheer wonder that I felt when I saw that film but this is still an accomplished film whos story is its strength and weakness. The story is a pretty good tale that paints a reasonably good picture of this far off land, although some elements of the plot are a little thinner than I would have liked (namely the samurai). However it still manages to be engaging despite this - although of course it was never going to be as personal a story as Spirited Away. The obvious message of peace between man/industry and nature is more than just the usual one; where Lord Of The Rings was very much nature good, iron bad; this film is a lot more balanced and doesnt look at either badly.While this runs in the background everything is fine but, when the film has to tie everything up it doesnt quite manage it. The ending is strangely very fast in happening and it ends on a morally good solution but one that I found to be emotionally quite unsatisfying. I must admit that the final 5 minutes left me feeling a little abandoned by the characters. However other than this the story is pretty exciting and the two hours go by pretty quickly.The characters are interesting but I never managed to really get behind anyone other than Ashitaka. Eboshi was too unpleasant to relate to while Mononoke herself was too distant despite the occasional times where I felt for her. Part of this may be down to the voice cast in the US version. In Spirited Away the US cast fitted the film really well, here it is less the cast. Crudup is, ironically, one of the best voices in the cast. I say ironically because I couldnt place him in comparison to the more famous cast. Driver is OK but her character wasnt. Danes is pretty good and I felt that her character improved due to her good voice work. Anderson was miscast and her voice simply didnt fit her character at all (even with the echo added). Thornton was good for the more comedic role but slightly took away from the dramatic impact of the samurai. Pinkett-Smith brings her attitude to the role well and both she and Keith David are funny.Visually it is as impressive as you would expect from Miyazaki. It all looks great, the whole land is filled with detail and it flows so freely. The spirits and gods are imaginative and very well drawn and the people show up just how basic stuff like Pokemon really is! It is a little too gory to be for kids (even though it is rated pg in the UK) but the vast majority of it is as detailed as you wished more kids animation was.Overall I really enjoyed this film but occasionally found it difficult to get past some of its weaknesses. The characters are not all as strong as I would have liked and some of their voices arent that good. The ending is a bit of a letdown as I was hoping for a more emotionally satisfying conclusion to the story. Despite this, it is still a wonderful film and easily one of the best animations I have seen.',0,'20 January 2004','0119698');

The characters are introduced very nicely by the director and since the movie is 3.49 hours long the director has ample time to showcase all the details and trust me neither the movie nor the direction or the screenplay will disappoint you.Acting is superb and once again Robert De Niro steals the show in the character of Noodles, he is a talented actor and a seasoned director like Leone has just adored the talent. James Woods has also been quite effective, rest of the cast were equally impressive.Screenplay of the movie is slow but effective and will not loose the grip from the movie, most of the scenes are so beautifully shot that it looks realistic. Climax of the movie is strong.

For the ears in particular, as FANTASTIC, deep, meaningful, powerful dialogue pours out of the mouths of the stars.Ironically, when I first watched this - not too long after it was made - I felt annoyed and exasperated with Damons character Will Hunting (hence the clever nature of the title). I just got fed up with someone that gave so little back to (or actively abused and rejected) 4+ great (if of course quite flawed) human beings who were prepared to devote so much time and unrewarding effort.This time round Im more charitable. Will is a genius that leaves supervising Prof. Lambeau (Skarsgard) in awe, jealous, admiring, and above all immensely frustrated. For Will comes from absolutely the wrong side of the tracks, and yet is a mathematical genius the likes of which Harvard/MIT have never seen, yet is listless and aimless and drifting over to the bad instead of the good, because of fearful psychological experiences from childhood that psychiatrist Dr Maguire (Williams) seeks to help him with, mostly to no avail.So Lambeau has his academic and other reasons for going the extra mile, the latters old schoolmate Maguire has his occupational commitment (though both are strained to and beyond the limit by their pupil-patient), but the Minnie Driver part (Skylar) just has her love for Will - and his throwing that back in his face hurts us even more than the other rejections. Seemingly most complacent and non-judgmental is Wills co-worker on the construction site and drinking and free-time buddy Chuckie (Affleck), who ultimately stops being easy-going when he shakes Will by saying that his non-gifted, worker pals EXPECT Will to make what he can of talents they would give anything to have.All the interactions here are exquisitely, searingly well-observed and magnificently well-written, but the genuineness of the Affleck-Damon dialogues are the ones that hit home most of all, reminding us of the remarkable kindness and insight and true understanding that can at times exist in real life among ostensibly non-intellectual, tough-exteriored working-class men.For most of the movie, it seems that none of these helpful and well-meaning interventions is going to cut any ice; and indeed the happy ending may look a bit too cute. However, we would have found the whole thing very tough-going without it.In any case, the film is indeed an almost excruciatingly erudite work of intense meaningfulness and genius, and a no-possible-shirking must-see for those who havent.',10,'29 September 2019','0119217');

You could feel his pain and you could feel his struggle and how much everything meant to him. It was paired perfectly with Hangmans character, who was executed without flaw. Thats what this movie was to me. Flawless.But this last part is for Tom Cruise. You cant tell me that man is almost 60. I wont believe you. His energy and charisma is what truly carried this film to a place in movie history. Hitting Mach 10, continuing to go after he hit Mach 10, going through the course in 2 minutes and 15 seconds. No matter what was thrown his way, he found a way to exceed expectations and teach everyone lessons along the way. His scene with Val Kilmer was so special. "Its time to let go". His struggle with how to handle Rooster being explained that his mothers dying wish was for him to convince Rooster not to take after his dad was powerful. I laughed at the many moments of perfectly timed humor, I was sucked in during the moments of breath-taking action, and I cried during every emotional moment this film had to offer.',10,'25 May 2022','1745960');

	values('ur1532177','I vaguely heard a few years ago that the director of PI followed it up by making a film based on a novel featuring drug addicts called REQUIEM FOR A DREAM . It got a couple of good reviews but I couldnt help noticing it took another six years for Darren Aronofsky to make another movie entitled THE FOUNTAIN which was one of the worst pieces of pretentious nonsense I ever watched . Still however the cult of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM grew and grew over the years . It is highly rated amongst the prolific voters on this website and has received almost aggressive praise from some quarters . And yet I had serious doubts to its worth as it was ignored by most award ceremonies and only received a very limited release in cinemas . Certainly I had no real intention of watching it until it appeared on a Sky movie channel . How good was it ? Let me put it like this - 72 hours after seeing it I still cant get it out of my mind !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! Aronofsky has made an entirely expressionist film . He expresses in visual form what the characters are feeling . This goes all the way back to almost a hundred years ago to a movement in Germany and since then we see influences in productions as diverse as the BBC serial of QUATERMASS 2 to Harvey Keitels drunken sequence in MEAN STREETS but I cant think of anything where this technique is better suited than here where the mental as well as the physical disintegration of the characters take place . The technique may put off a potential audience but thats the point , the characters are going through a living nightmare that they will never recover fully from and Aronofsky conveys their misery totally The director also brings a subtle in joke of semiotics . In THE GODFATHER before someone is killed the colour orange is prominent . In CHILDREN OF MEN someone is peeling an orange before theyre killed . Its a subliminal code used in films but one that is familiar to pretentious film students and movie geeks . When the characters enter a drugs den the audience are shown a close up of an orange being peeled and then all hell breaks loose . Expressionism and semiotics in the same movie ? Not necessarily the work of a genius , nor is it the mark of a genius for noticing this but should still be appreciated One criticism the film has is that its rabid anti drugs propaganda . Such criticism seems to be missing the point since Sara is addicted to legally prescribed drugs - amphetamine based diet pills and barbiuates . Its not a subtle film but does make subtle points that the amphetamine has almost certainly caused Sara to become schizophrenic . Likewise much of the drug taking and destruction is fuelled entirely by self delusion such as Harry and Marion wanting to open a store funded by the money they made dealing drugs . One criticism that is possibly valid is that theres medical facts that are ignored such as electro convulsive therapy being used on a conscious patient or how limbs are amputated but Aronofsky has rightly ignored these facts in order to make a more shocking film Make no mistake that this is a truly shocking film . Compared to this TRAINSPOTTING is a cartoon for children and no other film has ever portrayed the misery and danger of drugs so potently . Nine years after its limited release the soundtrack by Clint Mansell has become legend and rightly so . However REQUIEM FOR A DREAM itself deserves to become legendary amongst a mainstream audience . It is quite simply a masterwork and a film that whilst Im in no hurry to see again due to its harrowing content is a film I will never forget',10,'27 October 2009','0180093');

Simply, brilliant.Simple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena & Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.Sharman & Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we dont want the journey to end.Sharman really shows why hes one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. Hes perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!Madhavan as the guy whos chasing his fathers dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and its ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.Boman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because hes so brilliant! His characterization of the control-crazy, hyper-active, hyper-competitive, almost dictator-ish, college principal, is beyond words. He plays it so so well, that you love to hate him. Hes that Good.Kareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.And now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan, Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.His range is phenomenal and his characterization of Rancho in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person whos not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, its Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. Aamirs ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.This is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.ClichÃ© word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 P.S. Dont forget to say Aal Izz Well',10,'24 December 2009','1187043');

	values('ur5501912','"Singin In the Rain" I find to be a relaxed musical, one whose subject is the traumatic changeover that was faced by Hollywood producers, actors and directors when sound was introduced into film circa 1928. Many fans and critics believe the musical is one of the best ever; I disagree. But it is quite unusual in several respects, I suggest: first because its background is so realistic as a milieu from which to draw appealing characters and opportunities to introduce songs; and second because the film is played on the edge of parody without ever really falling into that error. The three characters at the center of the film are a love triangle. Don Lockwood, played amiably by Gene Kelly, is the on-screen partner of Lina Lamont (Oscar-worthy Jean Hagen); she has mistaken his sincere performance for real interest; he is in love with Kathy Selden, played by too-young but plucky nineteen-year-old Debbie Reynolds, about whom Lina knows nothing. The professional duo are completing one more romantic adventure film as a silent when suddenly sound is introduced into movies. The studio executives panic; and Don and his partner, played by Donald OConnor, convince the director, craggy-faced and very realistic Douglas Fowley, to get the studio to let them remake the film as a musical--completing the unfinished portion, etc. The problem turns out not to be Dons transition to talkies but Linas; she has the voice of a screech owl. Coaching becomes necessary; sensational dance numbers are introduced, including Kellys solo "Singin in the Rain", motivated by his falling in love with Kathy; Donald OConnors "Make Em Laugh" acrobatic classic; and the unnecessary but very-well-done "Gotta Dance" showcase ballet with Cyd Charisse as a gangsters moll, and Kelly as a Broadway hopeful. Then, the film is completed and debuted; of course Lina has found out about Kathy. And of course this intelligent satire works out well for all concerned, after some trials and tribulations. Great fun is gotten I suggest from the actors having to learn to "talk into the flowers", where early microphones had to be hidden, etc. Harold Rosson provided the cinematography, with art direction by Randall Duell and Cedric Gibbons. Nacio Herb Browns songs were intelligently recycled for the film. Arthur Freed, MGMs master musical specialist, had the use of the talents of Betty Comden and Adolph Green for the screenplay and one song, "Moses Supposes"; he also had then-28- year-old nice guy Stanley Donen as director, soon to add "On The Town" and "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers" to this triumph. Walter Plunkett did the period costumes, with complex set decorations being done by Jacques Mapes and Edwin B. Willis. The studios boss was played by Millard Mitchell, with Rita Moreno and a dozen familiar faces in smaller parts and uncredited appearances such as Joi Lansing, Paul Maxey, Sylvia Lewis, Kathleen freeman, King Donovan, Dawn Addams, Elaine Edwards, Mae Clarke and Snub Pollard. The film was influential, I assert, my criterion for including it among these reviews, because, immediately afterward, other 1920s and period projects were inspired by its success; these included, "Has Anybody Seen My Gal", the TV show "So This is Hollytwood", and ultimately "The Great Race", "The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond Story" and a hundred others, including a few musicals. I consider it to be genial, a clever period evocation, lightweight, exuberant, youthful, and a very seminal work with a strong central character and unusually-interesting reality background.',7,'14 November 2005','0045152');

When I found out that a 3rd part was up to be released I had been dreaming of it all the time. So, I went to watch it. In the theatre there were parents with their kids and thankfully they were really quiet. When the film started with the narration of the ages that had passed, I felt so touched. During the film I was back in my childhood when everything seemed -and were- so easy and I was with no concerns. All the purity of that age came and hit me, although I knew that would happen. I admit that I first found the story average, but when the film was on I was enchanted. There were no thoughts in my mind. I was there watching a masterpiece that in my point of view can be truly appreciated by only us, those who matured since the first movie, but still carrying all the heroes into our hearts. I must admit that I was up to cry in several moments, especially when the toys were in fire and in the end. Leaving the cinema and though I cried -cause, yes, I did!- I was too happy. Entering the house I was singing the theme song...I highly recommend it to you all!!!! 10/10...',10,'12 November 2010','0435761');

Mr. Gondo, played by Toshiro Mifune, finds has managed to accumulate enough of the company to take control and move in a whole new direction. He mortgages himself up to his ears, but knows the future is bright and he will recoup his money with patience and creativity. Just as he is about to make his move, a horrible incident occurs. He receives a call from a kidnapper, saying his son has been abducted. Strangely, the boy appears a few moments later, but it is revealed that his chauffeurs son has actually been taken because he was wearing some of the other boys clothes. The kidnapper asks for a huge amount of money for the return of the boy. The responsibility falls on Mr. Gondo, who, if he complies, will fall into ruin. If he refuses, he will be shamed forever, as will his family. The police are involved throughout, but must play by the rules. The likable Gondo is in a no win situation. This is an excellent movie, with many twists and turns, wonderful cinematography, all amid the cultural realities of the Japanese culture. We are also given a tour of the drug trade and its implications. This is more psychological cinema than police drama, though it has parts of both. An excellent film from one of the greatest directors of all time.',9,'15 April 2014','0057565');

Besides, they ARE cute, and I dont care if theyre marketable. Yubb Nubb!This movie always leaves me in tears. Its perfect. The end could not be better. Im excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vaders helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. Its very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - hes vulnerable.I dont know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant. Its so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I.

	values('ur93114713','Capharnaum - The MovieNadine Labaki always astonishes me with her work and this is actually my first time ever to write a review about a movie. But this... this is a masterpiece...Capharnaum managed to stir my emotions, it awakened my mind to things we see on a daily basis but decide to ignore. It was a big slap in the face, to be honest. As I watched, I hated myself for having food and shelter. I hated the fact that I paid 14.000 LBPs for my own pleasure and enjoyment to watch a movie. I hated the fact that I bought a $1 worth of pop corn for $7. Why do I get to enjoy a three-hour movie whilst others need that money for a three-day food supply? For those who still havent seen it, its a story of a supposedly 12-year old boy who gets sued for stabbing a "son of a bitch" (as the boy, Zain describes him). It depicts the life of a typical Lebanese poor family, only if the word poor was enough. It portrays how they eat, how they dress, how they talk and behave and what they do for a living. It was so REAL that I thought it was actual footage from Zains life. The movie also displays the life of an Ethiopian woman who has no permit and who was knocked up by some guy and gave birth to a baby she can barely support. Oh, speaking of the Ethiopian woman; I was meaning to mention, as soon as the movie starts, we see Zain at court and then we also see the Ethiopian, Tegist with tears in her eyes while waiting for Internal Security to call out her name. At this point Im really curious as of what this is going to be about and some guy behind me makes a "funny" joke about the scene saying "oh, so the Ethiopian is the star of the movie?"... I dont know why but I thought Id mention that because it left me in shock... well get back to that later. Capharnaum addresses poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, cruelty, racism, unawareness and child abuse. On the other hand, it also addresses kindness, innocence, forgiveness and faith. It is just amazing how Zain worked so damn hard to support Tigests baby all alone while his parents didnt have a care in the world for their own children. A 12-year old boy taking care of a baby was just so heartwarming and beautiful. Zains personality is amazingly complex and in him one can touch awareness and illiteracy at the same time. Innocence and violence. Politeness and insensitivity. Good and bad. Love and hate. He had a vision, he had a message. His message was bigger than governments and countries. It was bigger than you and me. It was a message that we decide to laugh about instead of help spread. The message is simplified in one word: AWARENESS.About the guy I mentioned earlier, lets hope he has learned something from the movie...Lets make this movie our prayer before going to bed every night... Then, we could try and change the world to the better.Nadine Labaki keeps on dazzling us with her great work... I cant wait for the next one. We, as Lebanese, are so proud of you. And the whole world should be. Much love.',10,'26 September 2018','8267604');

	values('ur3373011','After a lukewarm reception in 2001 with "Human Nature", Charlie Kaufman has teamed up with director, Michel Gondry again for this romatic fantasy. With a name like Jim Carrey, this second collaboration couldnt go wrong in terms of box office success, and nor should it as this film is quite simply brilliant."Eternal Sunshine" centres around the life of Joel (Jim Carrey) a shy, mild mannered man who is heart broken after splitting from his feisty, impulsive girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet). A short while after their split, he meets her again while she is working at a library and he is stunned to discover that she doesnt recognise him. He later finds out that the reason for this is that Clementine has had her memory of Joel wiped out completely. Dr Howard Mierwick (Tom Wilkinson) has performed an operation on her brain after Clementine visited his clinic to forget Joel. Much to Joels distress, he decides to do the same, but during his operation he revisits memories of Clementine that he struggles to let go of.If anyone was in doubt as to whether Jim Carrey can act, this is the film that will put all doubt out of the way. He performs with sensitivity and warmth, never once verging on the manic rubber faced lunacy to which he is most well known for. Out of all the perfomances where he has stepped into the dramtic role (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, The Majestic), this has got to be his best yet. Kate Winslet is also brilliant as his unpredictable, adventurous girlfriend.Kaufmans story of a man going into a surreal dream world is not too dissimilar from his earlier work, "Being John Malkovich". You have off the wall images such as Carrey re-enacting his 4 year old self along his journey in his head. The eccentricity of the story, which is Kaufmans trademark, once again works excellently. When watching this you generally care for Carrey and Winslet, in much the same way as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in "Lost In Translation". Gondrys diection gives a bittersweet flavour to the tale.The sub plots involving the supporting characters who are operating are ingenius. Tom Wilkinson once again proves that he is one of the best British actors of his generation and he is backed up by great performnces from Kirsten Dunst and a post-LOTR Elijah Wood.This is a lovely film and if you like originality with a sense of fantasy with a love story, then I suggest you see it. Its one of those films youll want to see twice.',10,'6 May 2004','0338013');

Each film explores some theory or notion about the paths of storytelling and the fragility of those paths.

But this is the most fun and in many ways the most interesting.Here we have three warring gods. Each might be the one who has created this reality or part of it. Each might be the liar who is telling the story. None can be trusted, or can they? The three are the `real reality in which we live, but that of course may be completely unfettered by any logic. In the sequel, Clarke has this reality subject to jingoistic forces. The new gods in the equation are two:An extraterrestrial force. It may have even made us and how we see.

It may be at odds with the humans or the aliens. It may not be, in fact the aliens may be machines and see HAL and siblings as the point of their efforts. HAL sometimes seems human, sometimes reason itself (Dr. Spock is the palest of imitations), sometimes in cahoots with either or both camps.HAL might be telling us the story, a point underscored by his camera eye. We cant trust anything we see. But along the way, we see some pretty impressive things. It it hard to describe today when every third movie has a spaceship.

I agree, but the violence was used to develop the characters personalities. It showed their disregard for human life and that our anti-heros saw killing a cop as being as stepping on a cockroach .I urge future viewers of this movie not to instantly compare it to Pulp Fiction and enjoy it as its own film.

	values('ur0016134','Theres not much one can say about this movie, besides "Be warned, its going to hurt you - a lot". The story is simple: Byelorussia in 1943 and its Hell on the Earth. The Nazis are fighting a no-quarter-given-or-asked war against huge Soviet partisan units, and the population is caught in between (historically the German security forces destroyed hundred of Byelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to "clear" the rear of Third Panzer Army). Those who havent been deported or killed by the Nazis are trying to join the partisans. One of them is Florya, a young boy - and in his quest to "join the fight" he get much more he had bargained for. Its a movie about an apocalyptic world (the title is taken from the Book of Revelation, a most of the movie looks like it has been filmed on another planet), but unfortunately it was all-real. The emotional centre of the movie is a lengthy sequence involving the destruction of a village, with all the sickening (but not exploitative) details shown with cold determination. Theres no catharsis (this is not Schindlers List!), no hope, no redemption - even the eventual revenge against the villages destroyers become just a sad and murderous business. "Come And See" is a difficult, violent and surprisingly poetic movie, compared to which even classics like "Saving Private Ryan" (Spielberg payed a homage to this movie on SPRs beginning) or "The Thin Red Line" seems just artificial. This is the real thing!',10,'25 June 2001','0091251');

	values('ur0278527','Many say this is the greatest film of all time. I dont know. Its such a personal comment that I dont believe even a modest consensus can be reached. That said, there is no disputing that this is one of the most influential projects ever done. Having read some books about Orson Welles, I still dont understand, other than having as strong a personality as is possible, how he had the film knowledge and vision that went into this masterpiece, on his first try. There are hundreds of stunning shots. The camera and what it does is enough to carry the film. The editing take us from place to place in a heartbeat. the characters are pithy and interesting, especially Kane. Then theres the William Randolph Hearst thing that is going on in the background. We see power; we see power corrupting. We see love of self contrasted with love of others. We see the oppressive cloud of loneliness descend upon the powerful. Wealth versus happiness. Which is, of course, the overriding theme. If anyone doubts the effectiveness of black and white cinematography, just watch five minutes of this film. More can be done with a few shadows than a full palette of colors.I first saw this film in college. We had a new student union which had a nice little theater in it. I had heard of the film, but this was pre-rental, pre VCR, so if one were to see such a film, you had to simply wait. Even television tended to avoid this as too artsy. I sat at the screening. There were a couple of football players in the audience (I could tell by their jackets). I remember being mystified and confused and wanting to see the film again. It took about five years until it showed up on television and, even though there were about 60 commercials, I still enjoyed it. When I got my first VCR, it was the first movie I rented. What a trip. Anyway, as we left the theater, one of the football players said to the other, "Well that was the biggest pile of crap Ive ever seen." This just reaffirmed that it was a great film. Im sure that most average film-goers are not willing to put in the effort to get the most out of this film. Thats their prerogative. Ive often hated pretentious films that others have clucked their tongues about. If you look at my reviews of movies like "Attack of the Crab Monsters" you will see I am not a film snob, but this is one great movie and I hope everyone gets to see it before they go down that last hill in that little red sled.',10,'10 March 2006','0033467');

The police are doing all they can to solve the case but, after several months, several murders and exhausting work, still have no clues. Their methods of trying to find the murderer start to adversely affect the local criminal community. Due to this, the local organised crime syndicate takes it upon themselves to find the murderer and mete out punishment...Powerful, provocative, thought-provoking masterpiece from famed director Fritz Lang. For the most part this is a clever, gritty, tense, film noir-like (as it predates film noir, strictly speaking) crime/mystery drama. Shows how the police go about their work and how often nothing positive happens for months, and then the smallest thing breaks the case wide open. The criminals methods in finding the murderer are also very interesting, and realistic.Lang maintains the suspense and mystery well, only revealing the murderer in the last few scenes and even then youre not sure they have the right guy. The last few scenes add a level of profundity and debate to the proceedings. We are forced to think about justice, especially vigilante justice, and the concept of of an eye for an eye. This can be quite jarring, as you may feel that Lang is steering you down one way of thinking and even wants you to feel sympathy for the murderer. However, ultimately, while justice was served, he does leave the verdict open to a degree, leaving you to fill in your own outcome. Moreover, the ultimate feeling was a balanced, objective discussion was had.Superb performance by Peter Lorre as the murderer. He only has a few scenes but is fantastic in them. Good work too by Otto Wernicke as the police inspector.',10,'10 February 2017','0022100');

	values('ur2533341','Note: I talk about scenes in the film so there are MILD spoilers.Yes, Lawrence of Arabia is remembered for desert vistas and sweeping battle scenes. The cinematography is unforgettable, the scale vast. In many ways, it defines "epic," but at the center of Lawrence of Arabia there is a real historical person who was also a hero worthy of classical Greek tragedies: a man whose virtues are his downfall. A lot of people seem to miss this, and often I think fans of the movie even miss quite why there is nothing else out there like it. Every aspect of the film, from the narrative structure to the staging of shots, revolves around exploring not just what T.E. Lawrence did but why he did it, and what it cost him.The desert is a recurring image, but its not simply a stunning landscape. Shots linger on vast emptiness, and suggest a blank canvas on which Lawrence can paint whatever he wishes. Profoundly alienated from his family and home culture, Lawrence pulls on the robes and persona of the man he might have been, if hed been born an Arab. The deeper his insecurities reach, the farther his ambitions must go. He conquers the desert, and the desert conquers him, demanding payment for every personal triumph.The desert and the visuals of Lawrence of Arabia work in relation to the narrative, characters and themes in a way that would be impossible without 70mm film, without the long, lingering shots that make the desert itself a character. The desert shifts and changes, shimmers and conceals, as mysterious and indefinable as Lawrence himself. Peter OTooles performance is mirage-like, with emotions flickering and disappearing. Just as some shots linger on a vast and empty desert, others linger on his face, frozen in a moment of internal conflict.Director David Lean cuts together close-ups and wide-angle shots to reflect the dual nature of his film as vast epic and intimate portrait, as when Lawrence journeys through the furnace heat of the desert to rescue a lost man. Consider the sequence. A speck in the distance; Lawrences eyes, lit up in relief and vindication; the man, who has expected to die, almost literally rising from the dead; they move toward each other, two specks becoming one; and finally: the impersonal specks become human beings again.Robert Bolts screenplay is elegantly structured to show that the desert exacts a personal price for every public triumph, and that Lawrences inner and outer identity are constantly in conflict. Lawrence captures a Turkish seaport by crossing the Nefud desert, but this success has required him to execute the very man whose life he just saved from the desert. Returning to Cairo to announce his military triumph, he helplessly watches a young friend drown in quicksand. Grieving and stunned, Lawrence approaches the Suez Canal and is seen by a British motorcyclist. To this man, Lawrence is a speck on the horizon, and when he calls, "Who are you?" we know this is the very question Lawrence is asking himself. The more Lawrence accomplishes, the more of a stranger he becomes to himself -- an unknown speck in the desert within.Eventually Lawrence must come in from the desert, and rejoin his own race-and-class divided culture. This time, Bolt hides the theme of identity in a way that can only be noticed when the film is seen more than once. At the end of the war, and the movie, a British officer shouts racist insults and slaps Lawrence down to the ground because he is dressed in Arab garb. A few days later, when Lawrence is wearing a British uniform, this same officer is proud to shake Lawrences hand.Still later -- but seen at the opening of the film, at Lawrences funeral -- this very British officer professes his great respect for Lawrence and berates a reporter, who really did spend time with Lawrence, for daring to be cynical about him. And the theme of identity comes full circle. Much as Lawrence fought for ideals his own people did not understand and against personal conflicts few would see, Lawrence of Arabia remains a film of many secrets, offering something new to discover on each viewing. It is the dual nature of Lawrence of Arabia, as an epic and as a personal exploration of the mind, that lifts it to a level of poetry made from images and dreams.Ironic that the film is like its hero: often celebrated but rarely understood.',10,'22 January 2008','0056172');

Its not that its a bad movie, rather I think that the film has been ripped off and re-staged so many times that any power the film might have had is rather dissipated. Its kind of like watching Citizen Kane or some other film that is said to have changed the way movies are done and finding that they dont play all that well. The reason is, like North by Northwest that they changed the rules and have been so copied it hard to see what was so revolutionary about them. As it stands now the story of Cary Grant being mistaken for someone else and having to flee from both the police and the bad guys is exciting, especially in its set pieces, but the rest of it isnt anything special and has the feel of been there and done that especially when compared with Hitchcocks other films. Most certainly worth seeing, just be prepared to wonder what all the shouting is about.',7,'25 September 2009','0053125');

Its also a strangely muted and anticlimactic film, posing yet another possible reason moviegoers watch it repeatedly: they hope (or need) to get more out of it the third or fourth time. Retired police detective James Stewart meets and makes over a woman who reminds him of his only true love--a suicidal woman he lost, but perhaps can find again by dipping back into the past. Hitchcock seemed to relate to Stewarts "Scottie" moreso than any other character in his films, and--having a gleeful touch of nastiness himself--is careful not to let him have his way. Glamour-mystery is gorgeous to take in, fascinatingly written and well-acted. Only one question: is the hotel manager (Ellen Corby) part of the scheme or just a dotty old broad? ***1/2 from ****',9,'7 September 2005','0052357');

Thats not to say there is nothing funny-- Jack Lemmons drunken dancing at a bar on Christmas Eve had me chuckling, as did his attempt to watch TV while consuming a not-so-appealing TV dinner-- but by and large, this is as cynical as satire gets in so many ways. Lemmon and Maclaines characters essentially prostitute themselves (figuratively and literally) in the hopes of getting ahead or fighting off loneliness, only to be kicked down again and again by life and other people.And in spite of the cold-hearted corporate politics, sexual sleaze, suicidal despair, and delusions of many of the characters, THE APARTMENT is kept from total hopelessness only due to the subtle, understated love story between Lemmon and Maclaine. Those scenes are played in such a natural manner, lacking the usual Hollywood histrionics or passion, making their bond seem all the more vulnerable in such a cutthroat environment.I wholeheartedly recommend this one.',10,'27 July 2020','0053604');

	values('ur5196156','This great film by Kurosawa is probably less well known than his Samurai tales, but is none the worse for that. The film is both long and slow-paced, but the impact is incredible.We begin with our hero (as Kurosawa calls him) Watanabes stomach x-ray, and we are told that he has cancer. We then see Watanabe sitting at his desk in the Tokyo city civil service, slowly marking a great pile of papers with his little rubber stamp. He sits at the head of a group of people doing much the same thing, shuffling papers from one place to another, and we are told that he has been doing this for 30 years! We see a group of ladies complaining about stagnant water directed from one office to another as the bureaucratic machinery churns mechanically onwards.Against this background, Watanabe goes to the doctor with his stomach complaint. He meets a strange man who precisely describes Watanabes symptoms, and tells him that the doctors will lie to him, as the disease is terminal. This comes true and Watanabe realises that he is to die soon. The stunning waste of his life then becomes apparent to him, and in a really powerful scene he falls asleep, crying below a commendation from the office for 25 years of service. He isnt worried by dying, rather hes worried by never having lived. He stops going to work, he buys expensive sake and goes to the bright lights, but this fails to make him happy. He then spends time with a young girl from the office, and it is on an evening out with her that he realises what he must do. This realisation is combined with a roomful of people singing Happy Birthday for a friend...but it is clear that they are singing for Watanabes rebirth. Watanabe goes back to the office and picks up the file concerning the stagnant water...he is determined to do something about it after 30 years of doing nothing!The next section of the film is the real key to its impact. We are at Watanabes funeral, with a number of the technocrats from the City Council. My expectation was that they would all be complimenting the memory of Watanabe and his achievement in clearing the stagnant water and building a park in record time...but they arent! I was frustrated...I wanted them to recognise that he knew he was ill, and fought the established order so as to achieve something with his life.As they drink more and more, they begin to reflect on what Watanabe had achieved. They become emotional, realising that he knew he was ill, and realising that with determination, the system can be used to achieve things. The final scene, however, is of one of the men present at the funeral subsiding below a pile of papers, unable to change anything.The bitter ending is tempered by the powerful feelings stimulated by Kurosawa during the funeral scene. I reached the end feeling that one man can make a difference if he is determined, and that this can only be achieved by reflecting on your life and achievements, and then making a conscious decision to do something!',9,'13 June 2005','0044741');

	values('ur19733576','"Double Indemnity" is a great movie with many great attributes but foremost among these must be its scintillating screenplay which combines wit, intelligence, razor sharp remarks and double entendres in such an effective way that, as well as being immensely entertaining, it also contributes strongly to driving the pace of the story. The quick fire dialogue and superb repartee are so engaging that they command the attention of the audience right from the start and also provide added impetus to all the action that follows. Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborated in adapting James M Cains story for the movie and the end result was nothing short of brilliant and was understandably nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay in 1945.The characters featured in this evil tale are very memorable and in the case of the two main protagonists are also very immoral. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a fast talking insurance salesman who goes to visit a client and in his absence meets his wife Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Their first encounter during which Dietrichson appears dressed only in a bath towel, leads to some flirting and their relationship develops further when Dietrichson eventually convinces Neff to take part in a scheme to sell her husband an accident policy (unknown to Mr Dietrichson) and then to murder him so that the couple can collect the insurance money and enjoy a future together.Neff advises that the policy will pay out double if the fatal accident occurs on a train and so, when Mr Dietrichson is due to go on a business trip, arrangements are made for him to travel by train. Neff carries out the murder and dressed like Mr Dietrichson (complete with crutches) takes his place on the train journey before the couple place the body on the tracks to give the impression that Mr Dietrichson died as the result of an accidental fall from the observation car of the train.After having carried out their plan successfully, the events that follow conspire to introduce a series of complications which lead to the couple losing their trust in each other and also to the movies dramatic conclusion.Fred MacMurray is perfect in his role as the very self assured Neff whos corrupted by lust and a greed for wealth. His portrayal of someone who thinks he knows all the angles but whose confidence is gradually eroded as things start to go wrong is very convincing and Barbara Stanwyck is also excellent as the cold, manipulative seductress who is utterly ruthless and seemingly devoid of any human feelings. Edward G Robinson appears in the role of Barton Keyes, a claims investigator who works for the same firm as Neff. Barton is very experienced and incredibly good at his job and possesses a strong instinct which enables him to sense immediately if a claim is likely to be fraudulent. He and Neff enjoy a longstanding friendship which involves a good deal of warmth and mutual respect. Robinsons performance is outstanding as he delivers some super-fast speeches and conveys the nature of his characters idiosyncrasies with great panache.In typical film noir style, the story is told in flashback with Neffs narration providing a particularly matter-of-fact account of what happened. When he says "I killed him for money and for a woman. I didnt get the money and I didnt get the woman", theres an inherent poignancy in his words but the delivery is completely lacking in any sentimentality or self pity. The same can be said for his remark that "we did it so that we could be together, but its tearing us apart"."Double Indemnity" is a dark thriller which became the prototype for many later movies which told similar stories but rarely with the same style and impact as the original. Billy Wilders direction is superb and especially successful in contributing to the high levels of suspense that are generated at various junctures throughout the action. This is a film of rare quality and one that, because of its subject matter, will undoubtedly continue to be a source of great entertainment and fascination for movie lovers for many years to come.',9,'12 December 2009','0036775');

Though it does at a moment become predictable where it will end. But being the bare witness to the demoralization and dehumanization of humans to turn them into killing machines is somewhat unmatched.The second half however is underwhelming. Few of the things seen truly feel impactful and thats also due to the somewhat underwhelming performance, writing and directing of Pvt. Joker. I dont know why they did it but his emotional vulnerability is all over the place, one moment he doesnt even care about a fallen squad member, and then he does, theres no transition. And it made the character unbelievable and thus ruined much of the emotional turmoil for me. The second half felt simpler and cheaper to me in general, dumb, ignorant soldiers in a war they arent supposed to be in. The acting just felt somewhat flat as well. Like the banter between Joker and Animal Mother. And the anti-war message was lacking to say the least due to a lack of visual despair and agony.The directing and music is fantastic (though not that bird song..ugh), not much more to say there than youll hear more than enough iconic soundtracks and beautifully shot scenes (set design mostly). Some practical effects and such feel lacking though and is inconsistent, one guy gets shot, blood splatters everywhere, another guy gets shot, and nothing, just falls down to the ground unconvincingly. This was especially bad during a ambush scene at basecamp where the enemies just played dead it seemed and fell with grace.So yeah, Ill remember this movie for its first half, but I almost already forgot most of the second half...definitely not one of Kubricks best.',7,'1 March 2022','0093058');

Now, with the significant advance in technology, and also the many modern con and heist movies with comparable plot twists and turns, this movie seems dwarfed by all those. Also I see that the movie didnt do enough justice on side characters that turns out to have quite a significance at the end, like Loretta. These characters dont develop well enough to be well explained. The acting overall is quite good. I think I now know how Tom Cruise gets his usual trademark of grinning almost all the time in most of his roles.

	values('ur0650255','In my experience, this may be the best adaptation of a novel that Hollywood has ever produced, the story having been taken from the novel of the same name by Harper Lee. Its a story about racism in the Depression-era South. Its a coming of age story for young Scout and Jem, who watch their father Atticus doggedly defend a black man accused of beating and raping a young white woman. It features magnificent performances from pretty much the entire cast. Young Mary Badham was actually nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Scout - but then, perhaps surprisingly, she went on to do very little acting. And what can one say about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. This may well have been his best performance; when I think of Gregory Peck its certainly Atticus Finch who comes into my mind. Theres an incredible mix of well known names in the supporting cast: Brock Peters, William Windom, Paul Fix and even a very young Robert Duvall. And there really isnt a weak performance among them. Most of the attention around "To Kill A Mockingbird" is usually focused on the performances, and especially Peck, but I want to pay special tribute to the directing.Director Robert Mulligan did a superb job as well, and while he went on to direct a number of other movies, this surely was his finest job. Theres a very good pace to this movie. It starts out slowly, painting an almost idyllic picture of life in this small town in the South, focusing on Scout and Jem and their friend Dill. Its summer, school is out and theyre just kids having fun. Its a casual and carefree existence, they spend most of their time outside, sometimes getting into mischief, sometimes investigating some of the towns mysteries - one of which revolves around the story of Boo, a local boy supposedly kept chained in his basement by his father. You get the feeling that if there was anyplace you wanted to grow up as a child, it was right here in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930s - Depression or not. Until Mayella is attacked, and Tom Robinson (a black man) is accused, and Atticus is assigned to defend him. Then the story becomes dark, the racism starts to be seen; the gulf between black and white must be a shock to Scout and Jem, whose exposure to black people to this point has been to friendly Calpurnia, who kept house for their widowed father and looked after them and was more or less part of the family. Mulligan picks up the pace of the movie once the trial starts. The trial proceeds at a frenetic pace - seemingly it all takes place in a single day, which perhaps makes the point that even with Atticus doing his best and making clear the truth of what had actually happened, there was going to be no long consideration of the facts - just a rush to a pre-ordained judgement, followed by a tragedy. Then theres the suspense of what happened to Scout and Jem on their "longest journey" - as the adult Scout (who serves as kind of the narrator) calls it in a voice over. But once that finishes, Mulligan changes the pace again, and the story slows down as the mystery of Boo from the beginning of the movie is revealed, and the film concludes on a very gentle and moving note. Just superb pacing from Mulligan. He was nominated for the Oscar as Best Director in 1963, but lost to David Leans turn directing "Lawrence of Arabia." Both were fine movies, but Id have given the nod to Mulligan.You could criticize the movie for downplaying to an extent the reality of racism. It really doesnt give us any glimpse into what it was like to be black in Maycomb - it gives far more of a white perspective on the issue of racism. But thats exactly what the novel was of course - a depiction of life in small town Alabama using Harper Lees own upbringing as a model. I also thought that the combination of the depiction of small town life (and especially the focus at the beginning and the end on Boo) was perhaps a bit awkwardly combined with the rape trial and the reflection on racism, although Boo himself becomes an example of yet another misunderstood figure in the town. Atticus comes across as almost too good to be true. But, really, theres very little to criticize about this movie, which deserves to be thought of as a classic. (9/10)',9,'19 August 2018','0056592');

	values('ur1471623','Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies, I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out, but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the films director Denis Villeneuve, I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film, or worked on the sides, but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it, you are not quite sure what will happen, or how the climax, or the ending will come, but when it does, it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch, not because it was overly violent, or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way, but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes, that we can not help but feel sad, enraged, or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars, tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget, big name star movie extravaganza, then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is, is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it, it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain, exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them, that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it, even if at times it is difficult, or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someones wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned, does put you through an array of different emotions, but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking, which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions, or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave, haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees, but having just seen Incendies now, I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it, go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010.',10,'10 February 2011','1255953');

	values('ur1075696','Sadly, there arent enough superlatives in the English language with which to laud Up, the latest offering from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is quite simply the best movie of any genre to emerge thus far this year. No small praise considering how Ive long been adverse to "kids movies", pegging them as being shallow, vapid, and simplistic - a personal preconception which Pixar mercifully shattered with 2004s The Incredibles and 2008s WALL-E, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that for all their acclaim as an animation studio, they are equally brilliant story tellers Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), who as a child meets Ellie, later to become the love of his life. Carl and Ellie find they share a common dream Â to one day visit Paradise Falls, a mysterious tropical oasis in South America made famous in vintage newsreels chronicling the exploits of explorer/adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Life, however, manages to get in the way as the two grow up, get married, experience the pain of miscarriage, and eventually grow old, so much so that father time catches up on Ellie, leaving Carl a widower. All of this is conveyed with little dialog in a masterful sequence that had the audience, old and young alike, sniffling throughout.If youre thinking this isnt the usual stuff you see in "kids movies" youre right. But all credit is due to Pixar and the directorial and writing team of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for realizing that children arent idiots, and can handle complex, often tragic stories, if conveyed in the proper manner. Its a refreshing change from the over-protective mentality that once saw all hints of violence edited out of Warner Bros/Looney Tunes cartoons.In Up, characters bleed, theres implied murder, and its all counter-balanced with some of the most delightfully twisted humor thats as inspired as anything the Zucker brothers ever came up with. The story literally had me careening from being misty-eyed to laughing heartily, frequently in the span of minutes.Faced with forced relocation to a retirement home, Carl opts for one final gambit, to fly his house down to Paradise Falls with the aid of a multitude of helium-filled balloons affixed to the roof of his house. Along for the ride is Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Scout seeking to add a merit badge to his collection. Eventually the duo are complimented by Dug (voiced by co-director and writer Bob Peterson) a dopey derelict dog equipped by the now aged Muntz with a translator collar that converts dog thoughts to English.Like WALL-E, Up manages to imbue its characters with depth and humanity, while at the same time tell a story that is mature, delightful, and most of all, terrifically funny. In an era when Hollywood seems only capable of re-boots and do-overs, Up is not merely a refreshing stroke of original brilliance, it is likely the best movie you will see all year.... or until Pixar emerges with their next effort.',10,'30 May 2009','1049413');

If the films intelligent, appropriately epic, character-driven screenplay wasnt enough to make this a great film, then surely Manns brilliant direction, Dante Spinottis photography, and Elliot Goldenthals memorable score make this a great film.Of course, the big selling point for "Heat" to this day is the union of screen legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. I am not certain whether the films excellent screenplay was written by Mann with these two actors in mind, but it doesnt feel like it because it does not feel for a second like a cheap marketing gimmick, and the two actors actually share very little screen time together (for the first time, as despite both of them appearing in "The Godfather: Part II", they were not in any scenes together). When they do, it is tasteful and interesting. The scene in the diner where they first really meet, not counting a quick encounter on the street just before, is perhaps the true centerpiece of the film, even more so than the famed shootout. In that short, beautiful scene the two main characters discover just how similar to and yet different from each other they are. The film is brilliantly. It is around three hours in length, but passes faster than most 90 minute films. The film masterfully builds tension while developing characters in its early stages in what some might call subplots, which is entirely missing the point of this film being driven by the characters rather than strictly by the plot. The film has a loose main plot, but is a true epic, one which concentrates on many different characters and stories in almost equal measure. It builds up to a climax which lasts for an entire hour, a riveting, spectacular, epic, brilliant hour of film that begins with the shootout. Oh, the great, famous "Heat" shootout in the middle of the street in broad daylight. My opinion may be blasphemy to some, but I think this is one of the best and most exciting scenes in film history. Its as well-shot and edited as any of cinemas most well-known action scenes.The immediate thing that stands out about the visual look of the film is how carefully and beautifully composed some of the shots are, the prime example being the films stunning final shot (which follows an equally astonishing final sequence), which is certainly up there with the great final shots in cinema. The films look cannot be credited entirely to Mann, as frequent Mann collaborator (The Last of the Mohicans, The Insider) Dante Spinottis work as cinematographer is certainly impressive as well. This cast is certainly much bigger than Pacino and De Niro, and I cant think of one performance, not even Jon Voights that can be called anything less than excellent. From Val Kilmer to Tom Sizemore to Ted Levine to Ashley Judd, the supporting cast is terrific. Even Natalie Portmans good."Heat" is a masterclass. The writing, direction, cinematography, acting, everything about the film is great from start to finish. Truly a brilliant film, and one that will not be forgotten anytime soon. It doesnt work because it is a good crime thriller, it works because its a terrific character drama, one which I find more and more involving with every viewing.',0,'16 April 2008','0113277');

	values('ur2707735','In a calculated exercise, I watched "Raging Bull" and "Taxi Driver" back to back today. Two classics, and two films generally recognized by critics and fans to be among the best of all time. Personally, I think Bull was the better showcase for both De Niro and director Scorsese as the four years between films allowed both to improve on their respective crafts. In terms of favorites, that might be a moot point, as both are darkly disturbing and violent films, with main characters that arent particularly honorable, much less likable.Indeed, both characters, the fictional Travis Bickle and the real life Jake La Motta were haunted by personal demons that manifested as forms of mental illness. La Mottas brand of violence was legal inside the ring, what he carried into his personal life resulted in a lifetime of unintended consequences. The outcomes of fictional characters can be manipulated to suit the priority of the writer or director, so in the case of "Taxi Driver", the protagonist winds up as sort of a hero, at least to the parents of twelve year old hooker Iris. Im not sure if the point of the film had anything to do with showing how ones life can turn on a seconds notice or not. However when Bickles assassination attempt on Palantine (Leonard Harris) was foiled, the succeeding events could have led to his own demise. Instead hes reborn, sort of. One could sequel the story after Betsy (Cybil Shepherd) gets a cab ride from Travis at the end of the picture, but its probably better left to the viewers imagination.A tiny detail caught my eye in both pictures today which Im sure I would never have considered had I seen them days or weeks apart. In the carnage of the shootout scene, when the cops make their presence in the doorway of the rented room, Bickle puts a bloody finger to his head simulating a gunshot, and two drops of blood drip from his finger. Scorsese used the same device again in "Raging Bull", when Jake La Motta is badly bloodied in his final fight against Sugar Ray Robinson. As the boxer sags against the ring ropes, the camera focuses on the top rope a few inches away from La Mottas outstretched arm. Two drops of blood fall from the rope to the canvas to further intensify La Mottas defeat. At the time, I couldnt say why I found that to be so fascinating, but now I do.',9,'16 April 2011','0075314');

	values('ur5424352','Ever since Ive decided to become introduced to silent cinema,with Alfred Hitchcocks outline- setting film The Manxman and John Fords industrial revaluation western The Iron Horse,the name Fritz Lang has had an almost magnetic grip of being at the very top of my list,of directors whose work I have been eagerly wanting to view.When I heard a few years ago,about a "holy grail" being struck for film history,with a worn out copy of Langs silent epic Metropolis being pulled out of oblivion,and leading to the huge discovery of twenty five minutes of missing scenes/moments being found in the print.After reading that the film was going to be kept safely in a preservation society,due to the understandably fragile nature of the film,my expectations of this cut of the film coming out on home video gradually disappeared.Years later,I decided to search on Amazon UK to see what titles had been realised from The Masters Of Cinema DVD company. (the UKs version of Criterion) To my amazement,right at the very top of the page,was a very sophisticated looking DVD of the reconstructed/restored edition of Metropolis!.With having just started to discover the world of silent cinema,and looking at one of the most tempting DVDs which I have seen in years,I felt that it was the perfect time for me to see the full creation of Fritz Langs futuristic city.The plot: Being the son of arguably the biggest titan/philanthropist of a very advance industrial city called Metropolis,Freder has lived a life of complete bliss,where anything he has desired to achieve,has been reached to a level of success, that most of the residents of the city will never reach.Whilst out walking one day,Freder catches a quick glimpse of a girl who he instantly becomes obsessed with seeing again.As Freder is attempting to build the courage to go up to the girl,the girl is suddenly griped by security guards,who drag her down to the second level of Metropolis, where the workers who keep this huge city alive are kept,whilst the rich people in Metropolis live in mansions/villas on the "Top" level.Not being deterred one bit,Freder decides to secretly travel to the second level for the first time in his life.Getting deeper and deeper into the second level,Freder starts to become extremely sicken at the level of depravity and hopelessness that the lives of the workers have become engulfed in,with some of them even being thrown into a machine to die,just to "help" keep the cites electricity going. Horrififed by his discoverys,,Freder goes to tell his father Jon about what he has seen in the workers section of the city.To his complete surprise Jon dismisses everything that his son has told him,due to him feeling that the city must stay "alive" in anyway possible.Fearing that Freder might attempt to help an uprising begin,and finding out that some workers have gotten hold of secret documents which show the inside stricter to Metropoliss power supply,Jon decides to hire a spy called The Thin man to keep an eye on his son and the workers.Following him,The Thin man gets hold of the inventor of Metropolis:C.A Wotwang to guide him around the city.With there eyes all on him,Freder is eventually found to be attending a secret meeting,where him and a huge number of workers are getting told about a new philosophy from a woman called Maria (who Freder has been crazy about,since catching a quick glimpse of her on the top level of Metropolis)Attempting to accept for the first time in his life that a fall from power might be upon them,Jon and C.A. take the most drastic measures possible to destroy the bubbling uprising,by inventing a robot.Quickly getting hold of Maria,C.A. transfers her appearance to the robot (who he will be controlling).Having succeeded in the transfer of Marias appearance,C.A. and Jon begin to pray that their fake Maria will stop the up rising dead in its tracks,although none of them have any idea about how much (the real) Marias philosophy is affecting the workers,who are starting to build up into something that none of them may be able to topple... View on the film: The first people who deserve a huge round of applause are The Master Of Cinema makers,who have created a obviously lovingly made DVD/Blu- Ray.Although the "new" 25 minutes of extra footage does contain a good amount of grain, (which is understandable,due to the reels of film being left to gather dust) the footage which has been used in previous editions of the film,has now been given a mesmerising remastering,with the quality of the picture being one that could beat a huge number of films made today!.For the adaptation of her own novel,screenwriter Thea Von Harbou, (who Lang would later divorce,shortly after she had become a member of the Nazis)interestingly shows that during the workers revolt against the "higher-ups",they all struggle to become distinct individuals.With the first part of the film, showing the workers being used as puppets to keep the city alive,who are also hidden away as an embarrassing,necessary "evil" for the higher-ups,to the second half of the film,where the workers turn into a mass tidal-wave,whose destructive nature,leads them to even (temporally) forgetting about their children!.Along with the brilliantly tense screenplay of his then- wife,Fritz Lang delivers the film with masterful directing.For the two levels of Metropolis Lang creates two extremely different "worlds",With the workers level having a menacing foggy Noirish look,which helps to give a sense that anyone could jump out and attack you,to the top level,which is filled with mind-blowing technology,and packed with stunning housing.For the excellent characters of The Thin Man and C.A. Wotwang,Lang gives the film an amazing,creepy Gothic feel,with The Thin Man looking like Dracular working undercover as a spy!.Looking at the structure of the film,Lang seems to have created two distinct parts,which combined to make one unforgettable whole,due to Lang delivering an astonishing film,which mixes gripping Noirish moments,and still-stunningly executed special effects.',10,'9 August 2011','0017136');

The Big Nowhere, LA Confidential and White Jazz comprise the Dudley Smith story; Smith is the only constant in all three. None of the heroes are in Nowhere, Buzz Meeks being gunned down by Dudley while trying to escape, having hidden the heroin. Buzz White survives Confidential along with Exley, and White does go off to Arizona, but Smith still lives and rides high. In Jazz, Ed Exley~~Guy Pearce~~and Smith do battle for the soul of David Klein, who in the end brings down Smith. Of the three, Confidential is surely the most complicated since with the heroin out there somewhere, many more players are involved.Hansons genius is to shorten the story, eliminating Nowhere entirely, and bringing Dudley his retribution without Dave Klein being involved. He eliminates so many back stories: Exleys father is alive in the book, and a powerful politico to boot and this is just one difference, but in clarifying and making the story shorter, he almost makes it better. The murder of Vincennes is a brilliant touch, along with the code name Rollo Tomassi.Both the books and the film are pulse pounders, intense to the core. My late wife, who could never sit through any film without getting up for a cigarette, was immobilized, and by the end was screaming "Kill him" as Exley watched Smith depart. If I had one slight criticism, it would be the cleaning up of some of the language about the original suspects in the Nite Owl killings, but make no mistake about it, this is the film for the 90s, and the only 1997 Oscar nominee worth watching.

Snatch is a roller-coaster ride that you just sit back and enjoy. It is a brilliantly funny movie, with an unimportant story which still takes a couple of viewings to fully absorb. Add to that a fantastic cast, including Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, the dog, and Alan Ford as the sweet-natured Brick Top. Add to *that* that Guy Ritchies fantastic way of using his camera and music to give the fantastic flair that is the trademark of his "lorry-gangsta" films. What more could you want?Everyones raving about Brad Pitts performance as the incomprehensible Mickey, and yes, hes great. But Rabe Serbedzija doesnt get nearly enough attention as Boris the Blade! This guy is pure comic genius. Watch the scene where hes selling a gun to Turkishs partner Tommy. A fantastic actor all around. But what am I talking about? Literally every single actor is hilarious in this film. Benicio Del Toro is a complete psycho, Jason Statham keeps burning his buddy Tommy, Alan Ford is brutal (in more than one way) as the crime boss who feeds people to the pigs. The rather unknown Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade all hit the right notes as three slightly-less-than-competent street thugs.Do I even need to say that the script is utterly brilliant? Who can forget these lines?? "I shoot you! You go down!"; "It was two minutes five minutes ago!"; "What? You dont think Ive got the vitamins?"; "Do you know what nemesis means?"; "It was *behind* you, Tyrone. When you reverse, things tend to come up from behind you!"; "Tommy, the tit, is praying. And if he isnt, he f-ing should be."; "Dont snatch!"; "I love this song!"; "Anything to declare?" "Yeah. Dont go to England."; the list goes on and on.Overall a hilarious, forgettable, but instantly quotable flick to just turn on and enjoy the hell out of whenever youre bored. And whats wrong with that? Do you really want every film to change your life? Snatch is entertainment at its finest, and if you have to whine about 1-dimensional characters, bad storyline, or style over substance, start a blog. At least then we wont have to read it.PS.

A family man at last is offered a job, but to keep it, he must show up for work with a bicycle. He had pawned his bicycle, but by giving up the family linens, he gets it back, only to have it stolen on the first day at work. He, his son, and several friends go to great lengths to help the man find his stolen bicycle, without results. Eventually the man resorts to becoming a bicycle thief himself.I have never seen anyone so ashamed, as this man was, when his son witnesses the humiliation of seeing his father caught stealing and mobbed for his offense. I was also stunned by seeing the size of the pawnshop (it looked like an Amazon warehouse!), as well as a "bicycle fence yard" that was enormous. During poor economic times pawnshops and "fences" seem to be the only ones flourishing.This is a stunning motion picture achievement. The poor film quality (suffering considerably after some 50 years) only adds to the authenticity. "The Bicycle Thief" is one of the finest films I have viewed. It rivals "La Strada" for my favorite foreign film. This film receives my highest recommendation.',10,'25 May 2005','0040522');

The Last Crusade improves on Temple of Doom while just lacking the brisk efficiency of Raiders. It looks fabulous and has a great music score.

The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indys fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indys father. On the whole, exciting, witty and fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox',9,'3 September 2010','0097576');

	values('ur10711233','Everyone knows Aamir Khan the actor - now they have seen Aamir Khan the director - a sensitive and artistic director with a fine eye for detail. A maker of true quality cinema; a director who extracts the best from every actor, every department, every person contributing to his movie.Ishaan Awasthi (Darsheel Safary), is a young boy of eight who admires and adores the simple things in life, such as Nature, colours, animals and toys. The real world - as his parents tell him - which consists of grades, neatness, and homework, is just too tiring and boring for Ishaan to deal with and he spends his time daydreaming and having fun. Unlike his older brother Yohaan, who has earned an admirable reputation for his top marks and studious attitude, Ishaan cannot seem to focus, however hard he tries, and reading and writing are torture on his mind. Ishaan starts a reputation of his own, one of mischief and bad behaviour, and is ultimately packed off to boarding school, to be "disciplined". Torn away from his family, and isolated in a world of bright, prim-proper children, Ishaan is lost in a new world, of misery and and tears. His impressive talent for painting and drawing is barely recognized - he cannot fit in academically and this is causing him to succumb to stress and fear, not to mention killing his self esteem completely. One day a new art teacher joins his school, Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan), who encourages the children to think bright an bold; fill their minds with imagination; dance, sing, express themselves. As the other kids grow to love Nikumbh, Ishaan barely acknowledges his new teacher, and remains in his daze of homesickness and gloom. Nikumbh sees past Ishaan, and views the pain in his eyes, and using his kind, patient nature, he discovers that Ishaan suffers from Dyslexia - a learning disorder which is the cause of his low marks. Nikumbh holds out a helping hand to Ishaan, and becomes the one person to look past the grades and see the boy inside, resulting in a close and caring friendship, and exulting Ishaan into the clouds once more - but this time to find his foothold.Taare Zameen Par is Aamir Khans directorial debut, as well as his debut as a producer. One very impressive thing about his direction is the pace of the movie, which progresses naturally until the very end. The cinematography and production design were superb, as was the music. The added animation, which surprised me, was better than anything I expected for a Bollywood movie; much crisper and sharper, transporting the viewer to the world of Ishaans dreams. The A-Grade script by Amol Gupte also contributes greatly, and I did not find the ending to be "cheesy" or too dramatic in the slightest.The fine performance by Darsheel Safary stands out, and the little one is sure to be remembered for his fantastic portrayal of Ishaan Awasthi. Though I found he didnt speak much throughout the movie, he brought a life to his role and endeared himself to the audience. His performance brought a lump to my throat on more than one occasion, and reminded me of certain parts of my childhood. Whenever anyone says CHILD STAR, I will think of him. Aamir surprised me once more by letting the little one carry the movie forward, and only appearing just about halfway. Even then, Aamir did not steal the film, though he did give a powerful performance, and the spotlight was kept on Darsheel. The two actors playing Ishaans parents, Tisca Chopra and Vipin Sharma, were adequate, though I was more impressed with Chopra than her male counterpart. The chemistry between the cast seemed good, though I thought Darsheel and Aamirs on screen connection could have seemed stronger.The soundtrack amazed me. My favourite song, had to be Maa. The amount tears I shed during that one song is hard to explain. The beautiful lyrics added to the charm of the song, and even hearing it now makes me want to cry my heart out. Bum Bum Bole is a lighthearted and catchy track picturised on Aamir, and Jame Raho is an addictive number which was used and picturised very well. Kholo Kholo is a soulful song with again, gorgeous lyrics, leaving Bheja Kum, an interesting track, used to show Ishaans trouble at Boarding School. The title track was also lovely.I really regret not having seen this when it released. After viewing it, I strongly believe this is the best movie that came out in 2007, every film seems weak before Taare Zameen Par, it overshadows almost every movie by far.A great and inspiring experience.',0,'25 March 2008','0986264');

	values('ur1148847','You couldnt really expect to make a typical movie out of the story of last days of the archetypal fascist dictator. Untergang seeks to illustrate the situation of sane people under the control of a madman; that and the impending arrival of the Red Army is the only dramatic jeopardy available - no romantic interlude, nothing to achieve, no sentimental buddy rescue shtick. We witness the reactions of people like you and me (and dont be silly enough to imagine I include Goebbels, etc. - I mean people doing their jobs under impending calamity) who happened to be in the wrongest place at the wrongest time. If this dilemma doesnt absorb you, its a fault of your imagination, not of the utterly brilliant recreation of something very few people survived to bear witness to. Untergang doesnt seek to make a judgment of Hitler because it doesnt need to: all you need to appreciate is his increasing detachment from reality and the way that this divides the people stuck with him. If theres any sort of judgment, its of the herd mentality of people as a whole. The film becomes a series of stunning docu-vignettes of the various levels of humanity involved, each one posing the question What would YOU have done?. This film is thought-provoking, and that naturally makes many denizens of the internet uncomfortable.',10,'29 June 2008','0363163');

	values('ur44546721','If I had seen Dangal last year, it would have easily blazed into my Top 30 list. Being a sport genre film, you will know what will transpire in the final climatic scene from a mile away, but it does hit all the usual tropes and emotional beats with verve and aplomb. The good ones in this genre know how to make the arduous learning journey resemble inspirational life lessons and will also make you feel vested in the story. This is not just a good one, it is a great one. Dangal is a biographical sports drama film directed by Nitesh Tiwari. It stars Aamir Khan as Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. The former is Indias first female wrestler to win at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where she won the gold medal (55 kg). Her sister Babita Kumari won the silver (51 kg). I have seen inspirational life-affirming stories like this but what makes Dangal stands out from the multitude is that it got all the basics right. The film never sermonises the age old themes like sexism, gender inequality and patriotism, instead it hits the usual repertoire of greatest hits with a deft balance. There was never any need to hammer some of the ideas into your consciousness like nails to a wall. It trusts us to understand the issues because so many predecessors have already done so. It just presents them in a refreshing way to make them come up smelling like roses. For example, in a scene where the sisters lament their father for forcing them to learn wrestling, their friend who is a young bride-to-be shares with them how she wishes she has a father like theirs. In that simple monologue, a light is shone on the plight of the female gender in India. The film also got another aspect right - it manages to explain the sport with superb clarity, so much so that it almost feels like a wrestling 101 manual. It is never boring or preachy, and when the climax rolls in like the tide, you will smile gleefully because it has succeeded in actually making you feel smart. Talking about the climax, my wifey turned to me and whispered how the final bout would be won. I concurred and added that it will be underscored in extreme slow-mo. Of course, both of us were right. But the thing to remember is that even if we could guess it, it is always the mechanics behind we couldnt see. By then we were so vested in the story we were welcoming the final scene with opened arms and warm streaming tears. Dangal is also buoyed by convincing fight choreography and the wrestling sequences are well shot and without quick edits which are cheat-codes. You will believe the principals are wrestlers first and actors second. Fatima Sana Shaikh (Geeta) and Sanya Malhotra (Babita) are truly commendable in their roles. Even all the peripheral parts are well portrayed. That leaves Aamir Khan, who went over and above himself to turn in a superb performance and to think that he put on 38% body fat to play the role really made me want to salute him. But when I learned that he later went back to a lean mean fighting machine to play a much younger man in the initial part of the film, I wanted to bow down in front of the master. This is one powder keg of a movie with loads of great humour and infectious music. It doesnt matter that it is familiar because it feels like a great home-cooked meal and the Yoda-esque training lessons mirror what life throws at you. This one will definitely make you appreciate the sport that has been demonised and trivialised by WWF.',8,'5 January 2017','5074352');

	values('ur9972457','This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isnt saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components dont feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Waynes childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed, if it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere truly spectacular.',10,'18 July 2008','0372784');

	values('ur2483625','Billy Wilder being as daring as he could with Code still firmly in place decides to stretch all the gender boundaries he could with this comedy in drag. The results some say resulted in the funniest film ever made.Some Like It Hot concerns a couple of jazz age musicians in 1929 witnessing the murder of informant George E. Stone. Of course the head doer George Raft spots our intrepid duo and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are forced to flee Chicago.The getaway plan. Take a gig with an all woman orchestra going south to Florida. The orchestra has Marilyn Monroe as a singer so the trip will have its pleasant diversity.After the trouble Wilder had with Monroe on The Seven Year Itch he swore he wouldnt do another film with her. But United Artists wanted a big name for box office guarantee before he could get the financing and Curtis and Lemmon werent big enough. So Monroe was signed and by all accounts the picture was another trial to make for all concerned.Tony Curtiss feelings were well known about Monroe, he didnt like her. Yet his scenes with her were very funny indeed both with him in drag and doing a spoof of his idol, Cary Grant. Jack Lemmon was far more philosophical. I saw him in an interview once simply say that Marilyn was a girl with a whole lot of problems and unrealized talent when she died. Thats what you would expect from Lemmon, one of the nicest people ever in the film industry.Jack Lemmon also got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. But Some Like It Hot ran into the year of Ben-Hur sweeping all the Oscars that year. It wasnt even nominated for Best Picture. Billy Wilder lost for Best Director. The only Oscar it did win was for Orry-Kelly for costume design for those recreations from the Twenties and the special costumes that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis wore.Billy Wilder sprinkled his cast with a lot of people identified with the gangster genre. Who more than George Raft who really lived the part in real life. And others like George E. Stone, Mike Mazurki, and Nehemiah Persoff. Pat OBrien plays the federal man on the trail of the mobsters and in his memoirs OBrien thanked Billy Wilder profusely for giving him a part in a classic film when his career hit the skids in the Fifties.Of course the real daring here was Joe E. Brown as the dissolute playboy and his infatuation with Jack Lemmon in drag. Today Browns character would be really a gay guy whos into drag queens and Lemmon after some initial misgivings might just decide that gay for pay pays a lot better than playing the bull fiddle. But the Code while not broken was stretched a might in Some Like It Hot.A film that didnt get into the top five in 1959 is now considered the funniest comedy of all time. You wont get any argument from me over that one.',10,'10 August 2006','0053291');

Eve would truly kill her own mother for a good role - and remember the experience so she could play it convincingly on stage. She gives you the willies.Critics have raved about Bette Davis performance as Margo Channing, and she is certainly wonderful in the part. As, of course, is George Sanders as the evil Addison de Witt.But what makes the movie so captivating through to the end is Anne Baxter. You desperately try to figure out when her Eve Harrington is acting and when she is being sincere. You want to know. But Baxter always leaves you wondering. Is she overacting just a LITTLE too much? Is she sincere? Its an astounding performance.And, of course, the script, which oozes venom, is brilliant. But we only appreciate it because it is delivered by great actors/actresses at the top of their form directed by the author of that script, Joseph L. Mankiewicz.This is a riveting movie.

The dialogue was well written, and the main characters were equally as loveable. Viggo Mortensens acting was only overshadowed by that of Mahershala Ali, whose portrayal of an educated african-american man living in 1960s america was both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious. While Mortensen stood for most of the comic relief, I found myself laughing the hardest from Alis deadpan deliveries through the character of Dr. Shirley.The story of a black man who struggles to gain the respect of his fellow african-americans, while simultaneously resisting and pulling at the roots of the racism and oppression which keeps him from being as successful as the americans and europeans who should be his equals by all measures musical and educational.While the story and plot left little to be desired. I felt one or two jokes were shoe-horned in and would have been better discarded. The visual tone was fitting to the film, but the camerawork was nothing out of the ordinary.

Belforts charisma being able to attract followers in sharing his use of other peoples hard earned money to live a life of beautiful women, exotic drugs, lavish homes and cars, and the utmost luxury making for a lush life. A master at scamming so well, he is a loud flaunting target for the FBI. It gets hard snitching on your closest friends, But Belfort manages to use the chance to garner a smaller stint in prison...36 months.Leave the kids at home, because THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is forewarned a deservedly hard R, due to strong sexual content, blatant drug use, language, violence and very graphic nudity.

At three hours long you might have thought that it would be quite hard work but no , I found it an easy watch . That is until they showed the notorious footage of the concentration camps . Piles and piles of naked dead bodies are still shocking to see 75 yeas later .The cinematography is brilliant. The way the camera moves around the protagonists in the courtroom and the framing of relevant characters during questioning is second to none.The performances are great . Judy Garland really surprised me . I never knew she had that in her and Richard Widmark is good as prosecutor Tad Lawson but the outstanding performance is from Spencer Tracy . His portrayal of Judge Dan Haywood is fantastic. A more measured performance you are unlikely to see. A criticism I do have is of Burt Lancaster. His accent was shocking . He sounded more Irish than German .Maximilian Schell won best Oscar for Hans Rolfe and while his performance is great its a travesty that it didnt go to Spencer Tracy .It does feel Marlene Dietrich was squeezed into the cast to add a bit of glamour but her acting was very stiff as was her cosmetically enhanced face .I read recently that William Shatner is the last living member of the cast of Judgment at Nuremberg which is extremely sad .',8,'3 December 2020','0055031');

	values('ur14124007','At the core of this movie there is a long running philosophical question. Certain characters continually question what is happening around them, and through these questions, the themes of the movie are forthcoming. The most obvious theme is that of war. Here, once again, Kurosawa reminds us that modern warfare is not a place of honour or duels, but massed attacks on faceless enemies, shooting each other from a distance. I will discuss the battle scenes later in this review; they help us examine the chaos that is again consistent throughout the film. It seems that no one in this movie has any control over the events that are transpiring; not even the ultimate manipulator Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede has true control. This lack of control seems to mirror the idea put forward by the only character who is continually able to tell the truth without ramification. Shinnosuke Ikehata (credited here as Peter) is the fool who says Are there no gods... no Buddha? If you exist, hear me. You are mischievous and cruel! Are you so bored up there you must crush us like ants? Is it such fun to see men weep? Even if god exists then the only pleasure he enjoys is watching mankind destroy itself in the chaotic mess that is war. The final scenes see chaos erupt, as through the good natured actions of one man, 4 armies are dragged into a bloody battle. Which leads us to the idea of futility and death. The pointlessness of life is summed up once again by the fool. Man is born crying. When he has cried enough, he dies. Death comes to us all, yet it is far bleaker than that. If there is a god then they allow everyone to suffer. Even a noble character, like Saburo, dies an ignoble and futile death. Everyone within this movie is both hunter and hunted. It is a bleak world indeed.Then we have morality. There are very few good characters here, but there are three exceptions to this. Saburo, Lord Hidetoras third and youngest son, who because of his love and loyalty to his father is unable to not speak out at the foolishness he sees around him, which leads to his banishment. Tango, a loyal servant to Lord Hidetora who is banished with Saburo, but through love for his lord disguises himself so as to stay near him. Finally there is Kyoami, the fool. He again is loyal to his Lord, however, he voices ideas of leaving his side numerous times, but again his sense of duty and even affection keep him with his master.The movie itself is near perfect. Stylistically it is almost like watching a play. Both the staging and the style of acting are clearly very influenced by Japanese Noh theatre, with the slow and deliberate style of acting used, and the mask-like appearance of age notable in the make up of Nakadai as the seventy year old Hiderota. Every shot looks like a masterpiece, perfectly framed. Kurosawa trained as an artist, indeed he painted the storyboard for every shot in the film. The framing is perfect and in most senses the camera does not move at all, or if it does, it is simply to keep the perfection of the shot intact. Kurosawa was a master film maker, this is clear throughout. His confidence with film is breathtaking: only a director totally sure in his craft would dare leave the long, motionless pauses at the end of almost every scene, punctuating what has just happened and allowing the audience to grasp the full implication of the actions taking place.Kurosawa is, of course, well known for his ability to direct action, and this movie recreates war in a way few others have ever managed to do. There are two great battles here, one in the middle and one during the end. The final battle is perfectly staged, riveting, and speaks volumes of the futility that the lust and pride of Jiro Masatoras, Hiderotas second son (played by Jinpachi Nezu) has led to. But for me it is the first battle that is the one of the greatest moments in cinema. Due to council given by a traitor, Lord Hidetora has led his household, which includes 30 warriors, to the castle of the outcast Saburo. It is a trap, and Taro Takatora (Akira Terao), his first son and Jiro strike. What follows is horrific. This is the purist language of movie, and a thing of true genius. On the battlefield, even in the world of the Samurai, there is no honour, no real glory, only ugliness and death.It is interesting to note that seeing someone actually kill another person in this movie is rare. Considering the acclaim Kurosawa has garnered for the sword fighting sequences in so many of his movies it is interesting to note that not once do you see a sword kill another person on screen. Indeed, there are only two times we really witness one person attacking and killing another, other than mutual suicide. The first is entirely shown at a massive distance, the figures barely distinguishable, and the second, despite being amazingly gory, does not actually show the death itself on camera.Yet with all of this emphasis on framing, shot, symbolism and colour, Kurosawa manages to bring to the screen some of the greatest performances I think I have ever witnessed. I have to cut short my praise of what is a faultless cast and talk about Mieko Harada giving perhaps the finest performance in the movie. Driven by anger and vengeance she becomes something other than human, she is some kind of succubus, a temptress, a fox-spirit. Harada is at all times compelling, her every movement one of cold perfection and as we hear her silk robes rustling as she glides along the wooden floors we see before us an unforgettable creation of pure evil.',10,'6 February 2007','0089881');

The film is perfectly entertaining about casinos before it became Disneyland. There were other great performances by Don Rickles, Alan King, etc. The film is a Martin Scorsese film with two of his favorite actors--Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci giving Oscar performances. The script was fresh and entertaining. I also have to say that James Woods performance as Gingers pimp was worthy of being nominated for best supporting actor. THis film has several fabulous scenes and moments. By the end, you really dont want it to end because its that good. I love how Ace and Nicky (Joe Pescis character) narrate and explain the on-going activities between the Las Vegas Casino and its connection to Kansas City, Missouri. I really enjoy watching the scenes of Ace being in control and the corruption that occurs. But its that kind of film. You know what happens but you enjoy the ride anyway and I do enjoy this film. I always look forward to seeing it on the cable stations. Of course, Ace and Nickys friendship is the crutch of this film.',10,'8 February 2006','0112641');

	values('ur2923177','The negative reviews of this film on IMDb seem to fall into two categories: a) it was too violent b) the fantasy element was too mutedWithout getting too political, worse things are going on in the world at this very moment than were depicted in this film. While many people prefer entertainment that insulates them from the harsh realities of this world, one shouldnt get so indignant when a film portrays the world for what it is. CapitÃ¡n Vidal was a fictitious character, but there are plenty of people exactly like him. Humans are capable of terrible atrocities and looking the other way does nothing to improve our nature. If violence offends people so much they should do something about real violence rather than writing nasty reviews about depictions of it.The violence set a tone of desperation for Ofelia. Fairy tales themselves are extremely violent, and Disney cartoons are nothing like the stories they were based on. This film was rated R. What were you expecting?It is easier to understand people who thought the fantasy element was eclipsed, and were maybe hoping for another Narnia or one of the other countless fantasy flicks that has come out in the wake of LOTR. This film touched on many of the most fundamental themes of mythology, such as parallel worlds, dangerous tasks, hidden identities, sacrifice, and death. It did something more than the standard fantasy movie, which is part of why it was such a great film.',10,'28 February 2007','0457430');

During the eighties, when the cinematic Western was at its lowest ebb, I doubt if anyone could have predicted not only that two of the best films of the early nineties would be Westerns but also that both would go on to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, something that only one film from this genre had done previously. Yet that is exactly what happened. First came Kevin Costners Dances With Wolves, then Clint Eastwoods Unforgiven. In both cases the star also acted as director. In Eastwoods case he was returning to the genre in which he first made his name; this was his first Western since Pale Rider eight years earlier, which in turn was his first since The Outlaw Josey Wales eight years before that.In Unforgiven, Eastwood plays a former gunfighter and robber named William Munny. (Pronounced Money; there seems to be a tradition in Westerns of giving characters surnames which suggest they are for hire. There is Charlton Hestons Will Penny, and in Hannie Caulder Robert Culp plays a hired gunman named Price). In his younger days, Munny was a hardened criminal, but he abandoned his life of crime when he married and settled down to life as a farmer. At the beginning of the film he is a widower, trying to raise two young children on his own. He is tempted to return to his former life, however, when he hears of a bounty of a thousand dollars which a group of prostitutes have placed on the heads of two drunken cowboys who badly injured one of their number by cutting her face with a knife. Abandoning his children to fend for themselves, Munny sets off to try and claim the money. He recruits a former associate, Ned Logan, and they are joined in their quest by a young man who calls himself the Schofield Kid and who is eager to make a name for himself as a gunfighter. They are not, however, the only men in search of the reward; an eccentric Englishman named English Bob, who has won himself an undeserved reputation as a Western hero, is also trying to track the cowboys down.The film reminded me of another Western, Michael Winners Lawman from the early seventies. That film has at its centre a sheriff whose inflexible determination to uphold the letter of the law at all costs leads to tragic consequences. Unforgiven approaches the question of law enforcement from a slightly different angle. A key role is played by Gene Hackmans sheriff, Bill Daggett. Unlike that of Burt Lancasters character in Lawman, Daggetts approach to the law is arbitrary and inconsistent. He can at times uphold the law with savage zeal. He is determined to protect the two cowboys from vigilantism, but in doing so, he transgresses the law himself, dealing out a brutal kicking to English Bob and an even more brutal flogging to Ned which results in the latters death. Moreover, Daggett has himself created the need for vigilante justice by denying the full protection of the law to the injured prostitute. (The only punishment imposed upon the cowboys is an order to pay compensation to the womans pimp for the loss of her economic value to him). There is, in fact, no character in the film who is entirely sympathetic. Munny starts the film as a reformed character, but slips back into his old ways when he is tempted by the prospect of money. He becomes, to borrow the title of another Eastwood Western, a man prepared to kill for a fistful of dollars. The lack of an easily identifiable hero is a common feature of modern revisionist Westerns. Unlike some such Westerns, however, (Sam Peckinpahs The Wild Bunch is a good example), Unforgiven does not lack a moral centre. The Schofield Kid and English Bob have both been seduced by the dubious mythology of the West. The Kid, as his nickname suggests, is an inexperienced young man, but would like others to see him as a hardened and ruthless killer because he regards killing as something glamorous. Bob takes the credit for acts of violence which are wrongly attributed to him but which in reality he would be too cowardly to commit. Munny, for all his faults, can see Western mythology for what it is. Even when he is setting out to kill for money, he remains uncomfortably aware that "to kill a man, to take all he has and all hes ever gonna have" is a desperately serious business. In Ovids phrase quoted in the title, he sees the better path, and approves, but follows the worse.The first half of the film can be slow-moving, but the second half is gripping, as the death of his friend Ned leads Munny to seek a bloody revenge. As with many Westerns, there are some attractive shots of the local scenery (the film is ostensibly set in Wyoming, but was actually shot in Canada), but the overall tone is a dark, claustrophobic one in keeping with the films theme. Many scenes are set in gloomy interiors, whether bars, brothels or ranch-houses. One of the villains is actually shot dead in an outside lavatory. Of the two great Westerns of the early nineties, I would, marginally, prefer Dances with Wolves, which to my mind has a greater epic sweep, but by any other standard Unforgiven is a very fine movie indeed, wonderfully acted, especially by Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Eastwood himself. (Freemans role is a rare example of a black actor taking a leading role in a Western). It also asks some searching questions about the nature of law and justice, revenge and the roots of violence. It is interesting that Eastwood has not made any films in the Western genre since this one; perhaps he feels that it has set a standard that cannot be surpassed. 9/10',9,'18 December 2004','0105695');

I thought Meet The Spartans was the worst movie I have ever seen, and even though it is, because it is not a film in a true sense of the word, I have to go ahead and say that There Will Be Blood is perhaps worse than it. Because this is a real film, with a real theme and real actors and a director and so on, TWBB should be in the category of one of the worst films ever made.Reading through some of the glowing reviews here, youd think this film reinvented the wheel. They praise the acting, the directing, the cinematography. While Ill agree that Daniel Day Lewis was quite good, it does not make up for the rest of this turd. Im still waiting for something to happen. I know there was something about a bowling alley and milkshakes, but other than that, Im still waiting for blood. Keep waiting.Literally, I could not wait for this to end. My wife and I were looking at one another in the theater throwing our hands up in amazement every 30 minutes or so (2 1/2 hr. film) when the films plot still hadnt gone anywhere. Theres some stabs at religion, oil tycoons and imposters, but when you keep waiting for the plot to pick up and looking at your watch every few minutes, the film is in trouble.All this film can boast about is Daniel Day Lewis. He is a fantastic actor, but his over acted and misguided interpretation of this maniac is good but not enough to carry the film. This has to be one of the most misleading titles in the history of film. I remember snickers when sitting through the trailer of Blood For Chocolate. What the hell did that mean? But at least There Will Be Blood whets your appetite. Im here for blood. Where is it? A drop...anything? Sadly, no.I sometimes think the masses are sheep. How else do explain the insane IMDb rating for this film. Powerful? Brilliant? Classic? This sounds like something to describe Titanic or the Godfather, not this charlatan of a film.

	values('ur0182733','The Truman Show may be approached on one level as social satire exposing the emptiness of an American Dream defined by consumerism and purveyed by the electronic media over the last half century. Life in "Seahaven," the vast dome-enclosed set/community in which Truman (Jim Carrey) has been raised under the watchful eyes of a worldwide TV audience of millions, is a sharp and elaborate parody of the corporate sponsored images of middle-class American material bliss and innocence first introduced to mass television audiences through such 50s sitcoms as Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and The Donna Reed Show. A closely related target of The Truman Shows satire is the pervasive voyeurism and passivity that has increasingly characterized American social behavior as witnessed in film (ED TV), entertainment television (tell-all talk shows, Reality TV, the talent search genre), and even broadcast news (disaster/victim footage).Yet, on another level, The Truman Show, like Gattaca, The Matrix, Dark City and other more obvious examples of science fiction, deals with broad philosophical themes such as free will versus determinism in human action, subjective versus objective perceptions of reality, the assertion of humanness through existential rebellion, and the quest for an authentic self/ identity. Most immediately, the names and plot functions of the films two principal characters - "Christof," the megalomaniacal producer/director of a 24/7 reality TV show, and "Truman," the shows eponymous everyman figure - invite the viewer to approach the work allegorically.Legally adopted by a corporation (in a clever parallel to virgin birth), manipulated by the all-seeing all-powerful Christof (Ed Harris) into phony friendship and empty marriage with actor-minions, and psychologically conditioned (i.e. terrorized) into fearing adventure and change, Truman gradually begins to suspect that Seahaven is not the paradise it purports to be. To assert his humanity and escape his artificially prolonged state of childlike ignorance, Truman must ultimately undertake that most mythic of journeys, a Sea Voyage. At its end, he must turn his back on the secure, controlled environment of his "heavenly" fathers house and step through a forbidding black passageway that leads to the true human condition: emotional and physical risk, scary freedom, and - perhaps - real love. In so doing, Truman ironically brings to his TV audience (whether they are still capable of appreciating it or not) the very affirmation that the false god of television claims they receive from the contrived "hope and uplift" pabulum the show has been ladling out for 30 years along with its subliminal primary diet of product placement advertisement. In its climactic scenes, The Truman Show reveals Christof to be neither a social visionary nor a benevolent deity. Rather, we learn he has much in common with Orwells Big Brother and - allegorically - with the implacable, sadistic god that Melvilles Ahab imagines is running things behind the skys impenetrable veil. By literally rending the heaven of his imprisoning universe, Truman navigates his storm-tossed sailing ship toward a completion of the heroic quest that Ahabs mad distraction (and Melvilles theological uncertainty) forestalls: he momentarily frees himself and us from the diabolical/divine puller of the chains of human fate. In its final act, The Truman Show recasts the tragic despair of Moby Dick as comic triumph.',10,'20 February 2005','0120382');

Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.It is such a relief that the performances of Willis and the excellent Osment live up to an excellently directed quality storyline. I will be disappointed if the youngster doesnt receive at least an academy nomination.I seldom go to the cinema twice to watch a film, in fact I cannot remember when I have done it before. Tonight I am taking an old friend to see this film as it will be a tragedy if he doesnt see it on the big screen. He has heard so much about it that he is reluctant to go, as I am when something is over-hyped. Just for a change though, here is a film that lives up to its billing and has you thinking about it for weeks to come. As for the twist at the end?

In this genre, this one ranks among high.It begins with the extras: 30 minutes of deleted scenes with Howard saying that they are all beautiful, perfect but it had to cut them because of the time. Wheres the rule that says that this biopic must run 130 minutes exactly? The length is never fixed, it depends of the story.Then, he proposes a scene with his real father: "cut for show business". What are his values? Money over Family? One of the finest French director (Richard Berry) always finds a part (big or small) for his daughter in all his movies! Next, the movie starts and its the carnival of Horror: To depict that the story happened in the 50s, Howard uses very strong golden colorization! Then, we have to believe that Crowe is a 22 years student! And ice on the cake: his delusions are "real", which is total nonsense. In other words, the director found brilliant to embody his delusions like normal people. I didnt know that mental illness was a fairy tale! All the power of this drama is killed at birth and its a shame. It reminds me of the french movie "ladversaire" that stars also a psychotic. This one cheats all his family for years and its his ultimate moment that reveals his madness. With that climax, our french "Howard" thought also brilliantly to start the movie by the end! Well, the great error of this biopic is to treat illness like a thriller, a spy movie. Others much talented directors (Lynch) can really depict what is madness and a dangerous reality.Sadly, Jennifer isnt acting so wonderful to earn her Oscar instead of Crowe, who is really convincing as a big man becoming very fragile. If you add that the story eludes his first child, his homosexuality and his divorce (!) and that you saw all the Oscars it won, I conclude that Hollywood has really gone psychotic now! NB: My real anguish with that itself but the fear of the psychosis. Now, i dont see or hear delusions but Im afraid to face them in the future. So am i already psychotic and i dont know it actually ?',0,'3 November 2011','0268978');

This should cause much rejoicing among film students.I had a great interaction with my son-in-law on this. Hes a next-generation fan of Holy Grail. But when I mentioned the films insights into morality and human nature, he was a little taken aback. I gave one example; where Sir Robin gives the "canned" response to the bridgekeepers question, "Whats yer favorite colour?" The joke is funny because its a clever portrayal of everyday cowardice. And from there, the analogy expands. Cowardice begins with the denial of our own thoughts and feelings, out of fear of confrontation. What we have might be insight, but out of cowardice we hide it under a bushel. We can laugh at Palins portrayal of this, but theres a whole other level; a powerful, tendentious payload. There exist tragic souls who take this attitude to ungodly extremes; denying what they really feel to the bitter end of self-worth, of relationships, and even of life. And thats the genius of this scene; that Palin is, indeed, dispatched to the Chasm of Eternal Peril (or whatever its called). It was a small thing, really; a kneejerk reaction to a harmless query about his own color preference. But the end thereof is Death. And dont you forget it!And there are lots and lots of insights like this in Holy Grail.

After the two come into some money they decide to try their luck at gold searching with the help of a veteran (Walter Huston). Huston picked up an Oscar for his direction as well as the screenplay, which to me is the key to the success of this film. To me this film has one of the greatest and richest screenplays in film history and thats why this thing turned out to be the masterpiece that it is. I guess it shouldnt come as a shock to read that the film wasnt a success when originally released and thats certainly understandable as Im sure many people didnt want to see an ugly picture about ugly characters. The whole notion of the story is that greed is evil and gold can turn any man to do bad things. None of this is truer than when it comes to the character of Fred C. Dobbs, the Bogart character. Bogart deserves a lot of credit for being willing to jump out of his safe and comfortable roles and do something quite challenging. There are countless scenes that could have embarrassed the actor but he nails everything so perfectly that you cant help but think of this when discussing his greatest works. The screenplay allows his character to grow, or fall apart if you will, so richly that Bogart perfectly soaks up the craziness that befalls his character as the gold begins to add up. Walter Huston rightfully won an Oscar for his performance, which is among the richest of his career. There isnt a single second in the film where you think youre seeing an actor because Huston is so believable in the role that you dont for a second believe him as a real prospector knowing every step of the game. Holt never did become a huge star, which is a shame because he too delivers an excellent performance. As great as Huston and Holt are theres no denying that the film belongs to Bogart. But once again the brilliant and complete screenplay is where a lot of the credit must go because it doesnt shy away from the dark and ugly nature of man. Huston does a wonderful job in his direction because he holds the three characters together even as they each start to gain and lose portions of their mind, faith and reasons for being on the journey. In the end this remains one of the greatest American movies ever made and its riches are a lot more valuable than the gold the three characters are so desperately searching for.',0,'22 January 2009','0040897');

Needless to say, Steves amazing big screen version of the Michael Crichton bestseller not only delivered on the promises, making the film a deservedly huge box-office success, but it also redefined special effects for years to come.Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum play three scientists who are invited to a multi-million dollar theme park featuring cloned dinosaurs, which the owner (good old Dickie Attenborough) hopes the trio of boffins will endorse. However, when one disloyal employee sabotages the parks computer system in order to try and steal valuable embryos for a competitor, the guests get to see the exhibits extremely close-up, and must fight for survival against the mighty T-Rex and a pack of intelligent and voracious Velociraptors.The films plot is a somewhat stripped-down version of the book, and the narrative suffers occasionally for the lack of detail, but with Spielberg at the helm, the result is still a juggernaut of an action film that provides enough thrills, spills and adventure to make it unmissable for fans of creature features. The director manages to pull off some spectacular shots that are amongst the most memorable of his career (such as the simple yet iconic water-ripples as the T-Rex approaches), and with the industrys top FX wizards at his disposal (including ace animatronics expert Stan Winston), he has made a film that still looks amazing a decade and a half later.The best of the trilogy (although part IV is currently in the pipeline, so we shall have to wait and see what happens with that one), Jurassic Park is an excellent piece of cinematic escapism, and way better than anything Spielberg has given us in recent years (Im still reeling from the latest Indy film and the debacle that was War of the Worlds).',9,'15 November 2008','0107290');

	values('ur4445210','Although I still like this film - and proudly own it on disc - I have to admit it was a disappointment seeing it after a long period of time had elapsed between viewings. When I saw this in the theater in 1963, I thought it was spectacular. Later, when it came out on VHS, I thought thought it was good but the longer the years go by, the slower this film gets and it doesnt have the hold on me it once did. Part of that is that movies are faster- moving nowadays.It just takes too long (two hours!) before the "great escape" finally takes place! I loved the last 50 minutes. That, still, was fascinating as much as it ever was, even though its never been a happy one. Its still good stuff.The first two hours of this 172-minute movie turn out to be more of characterizations that anything else, although it details what went into making the escape from this German prison camp possible. Some of that is interesting, such as Chales Bronsons claustrophobia and Donald Pleasances eyesight deterioration, etc.With stars like Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough, Bronson, Pleasance and James Donald you will get some characters youll remember for a long time: especially, I found, McQueens and Bronsons.Now that it is out on a special two-disc DVD which gives it a decent picture (there was an earlier DVD that wasnt much better than the VHS) and some features, it should climb back up the ladder on my rating of it. Regardless, this will always be considered on the best of the World War II movies.',8,'17 June 2006','0057115');

	values('ur2707735','This film has a lot in common with movies that turn out to be a dream in which the main character wakes up to realize that what just happened never occurred. I find those kinds of pictures less than satisfying because they seem to cop out of a final resolution to the story. "Rashomon" takes a somewhat similar approach, but instead of setting up a dream narrative, Kurosawa has his characters relate the circumstances of a murder from the perspective of four different observers. I cant say that that isnt a valid approach, but the problem I have is that the characters relating their stories dont seem to have credibility on their side. If I had to make a personal judgment, Id say the woodcutters appraisal of events seemed most valid because he didnt have a personal stake in the outcome of a murder investigation.Looking individually at each of the players - the bandit Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) relates a tale that builds up his own self esteem - he valiantly fights the husband (Masayuki Mori), crossing swords with him twenty three times. The wife (Machiko Kyo) relating her version of events seems to be seeking atonement for her shame in being victimized by Tajomaru. The husband, telling his story through a medium after his death, seems willing to spare his wife the agony of betrayal and for suffering the shame of her rape. Finally, the woodcutter, who has nothing to gain by telling what he saw, except for the possible humiliation for not intervening because he was cowardly, was probably the closest to the truth about what happened. But well never know because the truth, which lies in the eye of the beholder, can potentially shift and change with each viewing of the film.It will probably take some more viewings of the movie for me to gain a greater appreciation of it. As with "Seven Samurai", I find Kurosawas pacing to be drawn out more than necessary; note the long time it took for the woodcutter to make his way to the scene of the crime in his version of the story. Im also put off by the histrionics of a character like Tojomaru, whos over the top and manic delivery make him seem out of control. Granted, these are matters of preference with me, so I look at them somewhat like the players in the film who have their own biases in telling their story.',8,'23 September 2014','0042876');

There is even a Kill Bill Vol. 2 which came out six months later, making the total time close to four hours.All of it revolves around a character who is left for dead and her husband-to-be killed at their wedding. She goes after those responsible, mainly "Bill," played by David Carradine.Personally, I liked the second film much more because this one got carried away with the flying martial arts-type violence. Oh, yes, being a Tarantino film its going to be stylish mayhem, but there is just too much of it.As in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and subsequent films of that nature, there is a lot of swordplay and flying bodies, floating in the air, doing somersaults and other outrageous physically-impossible feats. Thats okay if one doesnt overdo it, but, sadly thats the case here as "The Bride" (Uma Thurman) literally fights and defeats about 100 guys in one long scene. The violence and lunacy of that scene got tiresome but I give Tarantino credit for one thing: he did that particular segment in black-and-white, which was very cool twist.Also, there was too much Japanese spoken in this film with no subtitles, leaving all English-speaking viewers out in the cold as to what was being said. At least have the courtesy to provide subtitles if you re going to have that much unexplained dialog.Stick to Kill Bill Vol. II. It summarizes this movie and gives you a much more intelligent and better story overall.',5,'13 July 2006','0266697');

He slides in and out of scenes, you are always chilled but like the clichÃ©d train-wreck victims you see reeling on the side of the road, he never engages you, you never speculate on what made him this way, he is simply a nerveless, passionless cypher.Actually the clichÃ©s were too many to count in this truly, truly disappointing effort from the Coen brothers. A police officer turns his back on the monster and is promptly dispatched and of course the monster manages to squeeze bloodily out of his own handcuffs. Hmm. The instrument used to kill by Chigurh is some kind of stun gun with an oxygen tank. Surely to God he could get hands on a gun with a silencer and not have to lug this tank around like some deranged Fred Munster? There is so much blood, the only conclusion I could make was that this was the whole point, raise the barf meter with everyone, show acres of gratuitous violence to draw in the desirable adbash demographic and forget any kind of plot. A slasher film for the pseudo-sophisticated.The movie grabs you early and you think, as you survey a field full of fallen felons (they were involved in a drug heist) discovered by an officer played by Josh Brolin, that this movie is going to unwind a great mystery. You settle in for the denouement.Poor you. You are sidetracked by an absolutely meaningless sub-plot involving Woody Harrelson (another grisly ending) and by Tommy Lee Jones who was left without any relevant script and wanders cynically in and out of scenes, delivering tired old witticisms as a sheriff. We can count the ways and days of tired old cynical sheriffs. I was waiting for "life is just a box of chocolates and Chigurh the hardboiled candy". It would have improved things.I was baffled as to the narrative. Was there one? Why didnt I get it? Was this movie, in spite of the barrels of blood, too deep for me? I was asking myself these questions long before it was over.Was this movie reaching for pretension or was it truly in the stratum of the intellectual elite? Coin toss answer.For me, it seemed fitting that there was no ending to this. No plot should equal a no ending. The beast didnt die and went on his stumbling way. All the good guys died, apart from aforementioned slow-drawl sheriff, who is now retired.Zero artistic merit, zero plot. I gave it a 1 to bring down the over-rating. I still like Tommy, Josh gave a great perforance but Im going to be really leery of future Coen efforts.',1,'26 January 2008','0477348');

What makes these films interesting is the designs of the films as if they look identical to real life; now the creators have made underwater more realistic than ever in "Finding Nemo" where the waves of the water seem to have life of its own."Finding Nemo" is a story of a clown fish name Marlin (Albert Brooks) who takes on the responsibility of his young son Nemo after the mother and the babies were killed off screen. Now as a single parent, Marlin worries about everything that his young son does, even when he goes off to school for the first day.There is a universal moment in about every Pixar movie where there is always a human nature to relate towards the animated films; with Marlins parental worries as a single father, most of the dads in the audiences can relate to him, especially when Nemo is kidnapped by a sea diver after getting near a boat.Marlin goes through the sea of Australia where he meets with a blue coral fish name Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has STM (Short Term Memory) where she can remember things and than forget until the final moment. They go on adventures from escaping sharks, getting sting by jellyfish, swimming with turtles and going inside a whales mouth.As for Nemo, hes inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance."Finding Nemo" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time.',10,'11 May 2005','0266543');

Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is very natural and very realistic.

Ill just say it took me several viewings to finally figure out what was going on. Its not an easy to story to follow. Its also unusual: a crime story dealing with rights to water. To many people, thats odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California.There is nothing confusing about how this film looks. Its a treat for ones eyes, especially if you love that 1940s look, which I do. This movie just drips with Los Angeles film noir atmosphere: a rich-looking piece of cinema with great period detail.What stands out in most peoples memory of this film is another odd thing: a mans nose getting sliced. Here, its Jack Nicholson getting a "nose job" courtesy of some thugs. Jack, playing "Jake Gittes," will forever be known (among wild roles) as the guy with a bandage on his nose, thanks to this movie. As interesting as he is, along with Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast, I always get a kick out of seeing John Huston in here. I love the way he sounds and acts, and Im sorry he had such a short role.Overall, an always-fascinating film no matter how many times you watch it or how well you understand it.',9,'3 April 2006','0071315');

	values('ur107418055','What can I say about this now legendary movie that hasnt been stated numerous times already? When adjusted for monetary inflation, Gone With the Wind is still the most profitable movie ever made 80 years after its debut. Even audiences a day after its release were in love with this movie, due to the superb acting, casting, civil war setting, and of course, all of it made even more impressive by the use of Technicolor. Believe it or not, this was the first color movie to win an Oscar, which may surprise many people. The question that remains in many minds is whether or not the film is still worth looking at almost a century later, and the answer is yes. 1939 may have not been a very good time for Europe because of what was about to begin later that year, but many film critics cite this year as being one of Hollywoods best. So many classic movies were released in just this one year, including things like Wizard of Oz, Ninotchka, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Women, and this one. One of the primary reasons why Gone With the Wind still holds its magic after all these decades is because the story itself is timeless. Hundreds of years ago, love stories were as prominent as they are now, and Im sure theyll be around in the coming centuries as well. Because the plot of the movie is centered around this type of narrative, it will never go out of style. Add on to this big name actors playing the parts, such as Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland, and you are given a recipe for perfection. Despite it being a romance story at its core, Gone With the Wind is much more complicated than just that. The story starts (much like the novel) on the eve of the american civil war. It is the year 1861, and the gorgeous Scarlett OHara is living in sunny and humid Georgia with her parents, who happen to be slaveowners. Being Irish, she is pondering the idea of marrying someone who resembles someone from her ancestral homeland. To this end, she decides to approach Ashley Wilkes, but he rejects her, planning to enter an incestuous relationship with his cousin Melanie (de Havilland) instead. Shortly after, Scarlett meets a tall and suitable love interest in the form of Rhett Butler (Gable), but they are rudely interupted when news arrives telling everyone that the Confederate military has attacked the Union held Fort Sumter, beginning the civil war. This event (predictably) turns everyones lives upside down, and a man who Scarlett later marries (who isnt Rhett) is killed in the war. Meanwhile, the conflict is going badly for the Confederacy, and their luck runs out at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Scarlett manages to run away back to her hometown of Tara, only to learn her mother is dead from typhoid and her father is delirious. Once the war is over, Scarletts father tries to ride after a troublemaker on his horse, but falls off of it and dies. The movie then attempts to connect this part with the beginning by bringing back Ashley, but he still doesnt want to be with Scarlett. Rhett eventually marries her instead, and they have a daughter whom they name Bonnie Blue (after the nickname of the first flag given to the confederacy). Despite this accomplishment, Scarlett doesnt seem to like Rhett anymore because he finds out she only wants Ashley. After getting in a verbal fight with him, Scarlett falls and suffers a miscarriage. It gets even worse when her daughter tries to jump a fence while riding a small horse (just like Scarletts father) and the impact ends up killing her. Annoyingly, after all the abuse shes been through, Scarlett changes her mind again and tells Rhett she wants to be with him as hes getting ready to leave her life forever. He says his famous line, and Scarlett promises to regain his affection someday as the film ends. The first time watching this, I really didnt expect an ending so abrupt. Personally, I think it could have gone on much longer, especially considering how Melanie is dying towards the end of the movie because of the stress pregnancy put on her. In any case, Gone With the Wind is already almost 4 hours in length and that is all most audiences will be able to watch in one sitting. I saw this movie last year for the first time and was not the same afterwards. It really is incredible how they managed to do all this in the 30s with no access to computers or anything like that. Only the most determined people can assemble something of this magnitude. Yes, it helps that the entire layout for the story was already on display for all to see in a novel, but adapting all of it for the big screen must have been a huge challenge. Its a good thing they decided to use color for this movie because you wouldnt get the full effect of the civil war setting otherwise. It is mostly remembered as a war that happened in black and white, but thats not the reality. By watching this film, we can see it as people in the 1860s saw it, in all its horrors. The burning city of Atlanta, the vibrant colors of the plantations, and the beautiful countryside of Georgia are all brought to life here. Unsurprisingly, the casting is also excellent. Leigh plays Scarlett OHara, the main character, but overshadowed by Rhett in many ways. She is, in a way, foolish, and changes her mind way too often about who she is romantically interested in. This indecisiveness ultimately leads to the one person she truly loved disappearing from her life forever. Clark Gable as Rhett Butler may seem like a fairly stable, moderate guy since he is shown to love Scarlett and even ends up marrying her, but the longer their marriage goes on, the more strained it becomes. By the finale, his patience is exhausted, and feels no pity for Scarlett when she tells him shell never find someone like him again. Olivia de Havilland plays Melanie, Ashleys cousin (and love interest). Shes not featured as prominently as Scarlett, but her character still has an important part in the story. Shes the main reason stopping Ashley from being with Scarlett. The music in the film consists of many songs written during the civil war, such as Dixie and Bonnie Blue Flag, and you might notice theyre all southern songs because thats where it takes place. Theres also the theme for the town of Tara which has become rather iconic, and is usually the unofficial theme song of this movie. Anyone with a brain can deduce that Gone With the Wind was also insanely popular when it came to awards as well. In 1940, it set a record for Oscar wins and nominations, won 8, and was nominated for 13. This record stood all the way until 1958 when Gigi won 9 oscars, and Ben Hur the following year won 11. This enormous mountain of praise is but one of the reasons why people should watch this movie, even 80 years after its release. It is one of very few films that is basically flawless and strong in all categories. The casting is great, the acting is great, the music is memorable and exciting, and the story is as timeless as the universe itself. It really is among the best movies ever made, if not the best.',10,'27 July 2021','0031381');

The movie stars Nick Moran, Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, and Jason Statham. A group of friends put together a large sum of money to enter into a high-stakes game. They unfortunately lose and find themselves indebted to a ruthless gangster that employs a debt collector.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a solid comedy movie. This movie highlights the ridiculous plot turns that the story goes through. The story is able to keep this all together by having the four characters that the audience knows be extremely likable. Even through all the trials and failures that the characters embark on they have supremely likable qualities that the audience will laugh at and side with them on.The direction is elementary. This is owed to Guy Ritchie being an amateur, however the direction is entertaining enough. I enjoyed the story and there were not problems in understanding the directors intent. The direction is bland. However the writing in this movie is incredibly sharp and interesting. All of the characters feel distinct.I would recommend Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.Grade: B',9,'27 February 2021','0120735');

Of course they weren`t alone Hitler , Stalin , Mao , Pol Pot et al murdered millions upon millions of innocents and for that their can be no excuse , they have the blood of countless people on their hands , but these unreasonable murders were committed for the reason of utopian idealogy . Imperial Japanese barbarity had little if any idealogy behind it . Defeated armies and civilian prisoners were treated as cowardly " Untermenschen " to be treated with the utmost inhuman contempt and without mercy . As many as ten million Chinese died at the hands of the Japanese and millions of more Asians died across Asia during the Nipponese occupation . And it`s this rewriting of history in order to bring about a dramatic story that comes close to destroying the film . Nicholson stands up to his captors and refuses to be broken by them . Very dramatic ( Helped no end by Sir Alec`s performance . Perhaps the greatest actor of all time ) but in reality Nicholson would have been tied to a stake and left to starve to death . In fact Nicholson wouldn`t have had to show any defiance it was very common for Japanese guards to use prisoners for live bayonet practice just for the sheer hell of it . I take it because it was made during the cold war that Hollywood tried to rehabilitate both Germany and Japan by showing them in a less cruel light , but whatever the reason it is rather annoying to see prisoners holding concert parties in a Japanese POW camp . So treat this film as a drama not as a history lesson . For the record the real bridge was bombed by the American airforce',8,'21 May 2002','0050212');

I can see by the overall rating here in IMDb and on other websites that is has won over the majority of its viewers too. I guess Im in the minority here as I cant really see why this film needed to be made in the first place.Seven months after the brutal rape and murder of her daughter, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) decides to stir the pot after no headway is made in the case with the local authorities. So, she rents three billboards outside of her little Missouri town and posts three very disturbing statements which brings up the ire of the entire town - including that of her own son.This is one of those movies that is about the moment - not the end goal. It is about the journey more than the destination. Her reason for renting these three billboards in the first place is to find her daughters killer. But, that is not the reason for the movie. The reason for the movie is the three billboards themselves and the consequences she and others have to face by putting them up. Along the way, the original end goal, destination or reason (that of finding her daughters killer) is lost and all you are given to comprehend is the here and now.The acting was absolutely superb, I will give it that. But by the end of the movie, I was sitting there shaking my head. Was this the only reason this movie was made? To show Frances McDormands acting chops? This was reminiscent of another movie starring Nicole Kidman titled, "Strangerland". There is no absolution or resolution in that film either. If this rides well with you, then I think youd enjoy this film. If you are in it for solving the mystery behind the reason of the movie - you will be disappointed.Not a recommend, unless you want to see some good acting. For me, it was Just Okay - worth a watch, but ultimately forgettable.',5,'19 March 2019','5027774');

	values('ur1834062','It is doubtful that there is much new that can be said at this stage about this adaptation of Irvine Welshs triumphant 1993 novel of the same name. The film follows the misadventures of a group of extremely dysfunctional characters who are immersed in an underworld of addiction, crime, and violence. Their darkly funny antics are shortsighted, aimless, and nearly always have a tragic outcome. In this universe, the humane become casualties and only the most unprincipled have any chance of escape. Nearly all of the main protagonists are addicts of one sort or another, with heroin being the drug of choice. However, this film does not glorify drug use. The addict lifestyle and worldview is portrayed as being just as pointless and empty of meaning as the materialistic values and aspirations that are promoted by mainstream society.The richness of the material allows the audience to read "Trainspotting" in many ways: as a scathing social commentary, a superb existential black comedy, a bleak human drama, a gritty portrayal of addiction in its many forms, or as a meditation on the meaning of self and the nature of friendship in a brutal world. However one chooses to understand it, this film relentlessly challenges its audience. It is by turns compelling, hilarious, and horrific. Danny Boyles direction is truly outside-the-box in terms of his depiction of amoral characters in an amoral world. The dialogue is razor sharp and the acting is top notch. Special mention should also be given to the cinematography and set-design, and the soundtrack is flawless. This film is a classic.',9,'19 November 2007','0117951');

You have a recently sober father trying to earn the forgiveness of his sons for destroying his family years earlier, one son trying to provide for his wife and children, and the other son trying to earn money for the family of his friend and fellow Marine who died overseas. All of it comes together seamlessly and provides for a truly gripping movie.Its emotional without being sappy. Its funny without being goofy. Its inspirational without going over the top.

The plot, though simple in substance and style is brilliantly planned and educated. The film follows a disgruntled Korean war veteran named Walt Kowalski, who sets out to reform his neighbour, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalskis prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.Whilst both electric and brilliant, Eastwood fully acts his character to the bone and it shows that this is a character that has been perfectly created by Eastwood himself. Every aspect is detailed and visually amazing. Eastwood also shows us his dramatic and comedic side to Kowalski. The direction by Eastwood is powerful and imaginative which flows as boldly as the story. The backdrop to the film is mystic and thrilling as you dont now whats going to happen next, and Eastwood has crafted this brilliantly which keeps audiences on the edge.Verdict:Never since The Outlaw Josey Wales has Eastwood portrayed a character so thrilling and as exciting as Walt Kawolski. All in all this is a powerhouse performance which should get Easttwood an Oscar and a definite Director nod.',9,'14 December 2008','1205489');

They both go after different suspects and its quite interesting what the results are. Plenty of points-of-views of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it got me hooked for most of the narrative. One might be disappointed at the way things end but since the dialogue offers clues as to what could happen, one should still be partially informed enough as to the eventual conclusion.

	values('ur0453068','That one line summary refers to, basically, what it feels like to be a kid and get delighted by a story and characters that are (to use an overused word) enchanting. In fact, this film to me represents the kind of enjoyment I had as a very young tot watching the Winnie the Pooh films. It is so in touch with the innocence and escapism of children that it actually works for the adults too. As a man already in his twenties, I was really taken aback by how adorable all of the little woodland creatures are- the "King" Totoro, the Cat bus, the other little creatures alongside him- and how it wasnt annoying or nearing that. This is the kind of Japanese-export that puts an entertainment like Pokemon, which is all about conflict and defeat and trying to save the end of everything from some super-chu or whatever, as the fun if shallow stuff that it is. Here is a story that works much more like a fairy tale, where there is almost no real conflicts that are impending or spelling deep trouble, only the exaggerated thoughts and occasionally distraught emotions of kids 4-10 years old. Hayao Miyazaki is really, truly in touch with these feelings that go about with kids like these.If anything might be lacking in the film its a plot or sorts, as there really isnt any- a story it does have, however loose with what goes on. Its a pure kind of feel-good story about two young girls who have moved into a new house with their father so they can be closer to their mother whos at a hospital. After finding their house might be haunted, the younger of the two Mei searches around a gigantic tree to find Totoro and his buddies, who help make things grow in nature and are generally just there to act like fuzz-balls. Aside from a bit of trouble that arises in the third act, which does hold some overall significance to the implicit message in the film, its really got nothing on its agenda except to give the little kids a big smile and some laughs in some of the cuter, odder moments. If some American kids might not get it or latch on to it like the homegrown animation of late, it might still work for their parents probably watching it with them.And this message I mentioned- which is also connected with Winnie the Pooh on some fundamental level- is that its essential to have this kind of lively dream-life for children, to have a section of the world just for them where nothing bad or upsetting can protrude through. But, like Miyazakis other films, this isnt a message crammed down the kids throats. Its also for me (damned if Ill say it as a guy whos usually into more mature dramas and such) one of the most charming and cute pieces of animation to ever come out of Japan, and I would give it such a recommendation that the Pooh movies meant for me- as a first movie for a little one to see and maybe get addicted to.',10,'11 June 2006','0096283');

Some of them flying by in colorful shells with technical wizardry but little emotion. Others manage to touch the soul and teach us how to confront the wonderful mystery of life. Eastwood has put together a sensitive study of damaged souls and hope. He gives an opportunity to appreciate life and not to give up in the pursuit of our of dreams.Eastwood, Swank, and the always wonderful Freeman move effortlessly and interact with each other with fantastic precision and grace. It is hard not to think of them as fantastic performers and give them their much deserved dues. In an era when people are so fascinated with quick flashes and light analysis of important material, comes a small film that envelops and doesnt let you go. In my second viewing I felt I discovered more of its richness and grew to appreciate it even more. I truly hope that when Academy Awards (which supposedly honor the most accomplished work of the year), the acting, direction, and every other aspect of this film is recognized accordingly. There has been other phenomenal work out this year, most in small films. Dont let this be a make up year or a year that will eventually be recognized by "should have been" remarks.

Dicks novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to "retire" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as "Replicants". The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span. This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a directors cut to boot. A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.Ridley Scotts hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant. It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil. Corruption is everywhere. The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that weve seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.There is a hint of style from the 40s, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music. Rachaels entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40s.The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues. This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.The special effects were exceptional. Much of the set was pulled off using models. In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated. These guys really knew what they were doing. I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it. Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford. I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role. His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Directors Cut). Rutger Hauers performance was intense. His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical. Daryl Hannahs chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive. Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.There is more to this film than just pulp. It works on so many remarkable levels. The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live? Why do I have to die? What happens when I die? Doesnt my maker care? Is this all merely an illusion? At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant. Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today. In a sense, the ambiguity of Blade Runner is the culprit of its success.',0,'6 March 2001','0083658');

Although his playing of Terry Malloy was indeed Oscar caliber stuff, the award was really for a most remarkable body of work on screen up to that time. It was also for setting a new trend in acting style and influencing the next three generations of players.On the Waterfront is also alleged to be Elia Kazans answer to his critics of why he was a namer of names at the House Un-American Activities Committee. I dont think it was an accident that the subject of this film was labor racketeering. Forgotten by a lot of the people who defame Kazan today is that the Communist Party asked him to infiltrate and spy on not just actors, but various craft unions associated with film and theater. It was something he never forget.Hes often called a friendly witness. To me a friendly witness is someone who was an unabashed admirer of the House Un-American Activities Committee and its work, someone like Adolphe Menjou or Hedda Hopper or even John Wayne, people who were convinced these people were doing a patriotic service. In On the Waterfront, labor racketeer Lee J. Cobb, a bullying loudmouth of a man, runs the longshoremans local. He commits murder, extortion, and various other crimes at will without fear of reprisal because no one will talk because of their code against informing. Waterfront priest Karl Malden realizes it, but bangs his head against the code of deaf and dumb.Marlon Brando is a washed up ex-prizefighter who finds work on the docks through his older brother Rod Steiger who works for Cobb. Unknowingly he fingers Eva Marie Saints brother for a hit and then he falls for her. The film is essentially Brandos struggle to find out what the right thing to do in this situation.When hes on the screen Brando dominates. He invests the character of Terry Malloy with a lot of layers and the audience really struggles with Terry in his soul searching. He starts to see Cobb and to a lesser extent his brother Steiger as more exploitive than helpful even in his own life. That famous taxi scene with Steiger whos got his own life on the line if he doesnt get his brother away from Eva Marie is one where it all comes out. Brando got his ticket to Palookaville and he doesnt like the neighborhood at all.Eva Marie Saint got a Best Supporting Actress in her film debut. Shes pretty far from later characters she played like the cool blond of Cary Grants dreams in North By Northwest. Those were more the roles she played in her career than the working class girl of On the Waterfront.Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, and Rod Steiger all were nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category and they wound up splitting the vote and allowing Edmond OBrien to win for The Barefoot Contessa. The other nominee was Tom Tully in The Caine Mutiny. All three could have been winners.I remember when Elia Kazan died a few years ago and I think the unkindest cut of all for him was to be eulogized on television by Pat Buchanan. Though the left disowned him, he always considered himself a man of the left. One could fight injustice without submitting to a regimentation of the soul that Communism was when it triumphed. Something a lot dont realize today. The regimentation that Lee J. Cobb had on those longshoremen is what Kazan was expressing himself against in On the Waterfront. over fifty years later its a landmark expression.',10,'22 June 2007','0047296');

I didnt care about either one of these people, although the female character initially seemed much, much more intelligent and balanced than the male character. And yet she too got into the blab-fest and started to drive me insane. The man was judgmental and critical and dismissive of almost everything and I did not find anything about him remotely likable.If you think it is interesting to watch people playing pinball machines, walking through cemeteries, drinking beer out of bottles, wandering up and down streets, all while making peculiarly mundane commentary and observations and comments about life, youll have a blast. If that sounds like a cure for insomnia, youll be sound asleep about 10 minutes in to it.Absolutely deadly.',1,'10 May 2014','0112471');

	values('ur6458242','This movie provides a candid and dramatically powerful depiction of the institution of slavery in the United States. This movie touches on and in some ways dives into the many different themes associated with the institution. First, the movie shows how it corrupted everyone involved in it. No matter what their involvement, the institution brought everyone down. Second, the movie dramatizes the political consequences of slavery, how slavery exacerbated sectional conflicts and distorted political discourse. Third, the movie dramatizes the deleterious psychological effects of slavery. Unwilling to come to honestly come to terms with the nature of the institution, the movie shows how slave owner rationalized their own conduct toward the slaves, with devastatingly tragic consequences. Fourth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the United States to follow its own creed of liberty and justice by showing how free blacks were denied the full protection of the law. Fifth, this movie dramatizes the essential barbarism and degeneracy of slavery in the way it brought out and validated the worst in people. Sixth, the movie shows how slavery was a form of state-sponsored vigilantism in the way an entire class of people were subject to the full weight of the state with absolutely no protection. Seventh, the movie pulls no punches in showing the brutality of the institution, e.g., graphic depictions of beatings, whippings, fighting, psychological torture, humiliation, dehumanization, inadequate food, clothing, shelter, and terrorism - all happening under the color of law. Eighth, movie dramatized how by 1841 there was those who already realized that the United States was heading toward a civil war. Ninth, the movie shows how economic self-interest drove slavery, that slavery was profitable. Tenth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the religious community to take action to end slavery and instead used scripture to justify slaverys existence. This movie features many excellent performances, most notably by Michael Fassbinder and Brad Pitt, the latter giving one of his better performances. As for Fassbinder, his performance warrants an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. His portrayal of the angry, troubled, vicious slave owner who is deteriorating physically, mentally and spiritually carries this movie. This movie is worth watching. Dont expect an upbeat story, because it isnt. But do expect a powerful dramatic treatment of an unpleasant yet historically important subject.',10,'4 November 2013','2024544');

	values('ur3270789','This monumental version of renowned story during the time of Christ which was filmed several times, concerning on a wealthy Jewish named Ben-Hur results to be an impressive movie . It is a big budget version by William Wyler that won a record of 11 Oscars and was the most expensive picture of its time , being one of the greatest movies of all history. The story is well known , a rich Jewish nobleman Ben Hur (Charlton Heston in the title role, he was initially offered the role of Messala , though Burt Lancaster was considered) and his confrontation to military Messala (Stephen Boyd , though Robert Ryan was also considered , Boyd and other actors playing Romans wore dark contact lenses, so their eyes appeared brown), though they were childhood friends . When happen a distress , Ben Hur incurs the hostility his previous friend and is condemned to galley slavery , reduced to manning an oar , and his family is sent to prison during several years into a room completely locked . When hes in a galleon as slave rower saves to Quinto Arrio (Jack Hawkins) who subsequently appointed him as a heir . Years later he goes back to seek revenge upon his Roman tormentor . This culminates in a groundbreaking chariot race . As he returns Palestina where his mother Miriam and sister Tizrah (roles performed Martha Scott and Cathy ODonnell respectively) are prisoned at Antonia fortress . This classic tale is added religious issues about Jesus life , as are described the pilgrimage , Mountain sermon , Passion , crucifixion and resurrection .Lavishly produced by Sam Zimbalist and uncredited Sol Siegel, the production cost MGM a massive $15 million and was a gamble by the studio to save itself from bankruptcy . Sensational main cast and enjoyable support actors such as Hugh Griffith as Sheik , Sam Jaffe as Simonides , Finlay Currie as Balthasar , John Le Mesurier as Doctor , Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate , Andre Morrel as Sextus and many others . Marvellously staged battle ships and a breathtaking chariot races . As the chariot race required 15,000 extras, on a set constructed on 18 acres of backlot at Cinecitta Studios outside Rome , eighteen chariots were built, with half being used for practice ; the race took five weeks to film and 15,000 extras were used . Three hundred sets, five years of research, and fourteen months of labor were required for the sets . The dialogue , colorful images , majestic set design from Edward Carfagno and William Horning , glamorous photography by Robert Surtees , evocative musical score combine to cast a spellbinding movie . Rousing soundtrack by the classical MiklÃ³s RÃ³zsa who wrote the musical score over a period of nearly a year . His first-rate score deservedly won an Academy Award . The motion picture was stunningly realized by director William Wyler who took on the project because he wanted to do a Cecil B. DeMille type picture . Although William Wyler was Jewish, he particularly wanted to make a film that would appeal to all religious faiths . Wyler selected all the camera angles for the chariot race, but left all the details of its actual shooting in the hands of his second-unit directors Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt . Rating : 9 , extraordinary and awesome , it ranked #2 on the American Film Institutes list of the 10 greatest films in the genre "Epic".There are numerous renditions based on Lee Wallaces Ben Hur , as stage version , classic MGMs mammoth silent version Â¨Ben HurÂ¨ (1926) by Fred Niblo with Ramon Novarro; and this the remake Ben-Hur (1959) in which Stuntman Cliff Lyons worked as a stuntman/chariot driver in both Ben Hur (1925) and this one .

I dont think multitalented covers it. His acting, as his directing, is magnificent.Here he is Professor Isak Borg, a man about to get a prestigious award. As he contemplates his life, however, he has strange dreams. As he talks to his daughter-in-law (Ingrid Thulin), he realizes that the only difference between his life and death is the coffin. In choosing a lonely, cutoff existence and a life of cold detachment, Borg realizes that he is already dead.This sounds like depressing Bergman, but in fact, Isak learns something as he travels to get his award. Along the way, he and his daughter-in-law Marianne agree to give a ride to some young people, two boys and a girl named Sara, which is the name of Isaks first love, his cousin. Like the woman he loved, Sara is being sought after by both boys, and she flirts with each one. In Isaks life, his Sara fell for his brother. The situation brings back Isaks childhood to him, and he relives family experiences when he visits his old home and later, his 96-year-old mother and sees her own coldness.Isak and Marianne also give a ride to a married couple whose car has broken down. But their fighting is reminiscent of Isaks own marriage (and Mariannes to Isaks son, too, for that matter), and Marianne asks them to get out of the car."Wild Strawberries," referring to the strawberries that grew on the land of Isaks family home, is the story of a man coming to grips with his life - a life full of accomplishment but not many human connections.The most striking thing about this black and white film is the cinematography - the starkness of Isaks dreams, the family all in white against the Swedish landscape - so many stunning images.People call this film optimistic and uplifting, and it is. It is also profound, emotional, and very warm. Sjostrom shows us a charming old man whose niceness is on the surface only. While Marianne says that she doesnt like him very much, the young people love him and buy into his facade because they sense the real man he is afraid to show others.Bergman tells us that lifes questions arent answered right away - sometimes, it takes a lifetime.',10,'30 June 2011','0050986');

The cinematography is just outstanding, and helps fashion a city full of menace and the score is jaunty and flawlessly echoes the films wit and drama. Then there is a dark yet playful script(two other words to describe the film itself too), impeccable direction from master of place, angle and shade Carol Reed and a gem of a story that grips you right up till the ending. The Third Man is also blessed with performances more perfect than you can ask for from Joseph Cotten and especially Orson Welles. Overall, it is a brilliant film, very well made and has a great story. 10/10 Bethany Cox',10,'27 September 2010','0041959');

It wasnt that the print was so much better as I just appreciated Buster Keatons humor and physical prowess more today than I did back when I first saw this film. That, and I can never get enough trains on film!Keaton plays "Johnny Gray," a railroad engineer who signs up for the Confederate army when the Civil War breaks out. However, they reject because the South felt he could be far more valuable to their cause if he remained in his occupation than as a soldier. However, because his girlfriend wants him to sign up, and her brothers all did, she thinks hes a coward because hes not fighting for his kinfolk (obviously not knowing why they turned him down). So, things look bleak for our hero. (Note: true love never seems to be shown in these Keaton films. Buster always has to prove himself to these fickle women, who demand either heroes or tons of money from their men.)Anyway, Buster is chased down the tracks by the Northern army train for much of the film. He tries to hold them off and keep his own little train running....and rescue his girlfriend who was accidentally abducted by the enemy and is being held hostage in one of the cars. Its not as chaotic as I am making it sound, but its fast-moving and entertaining film for most of the 75 minutes. To be honest, I cant see where its a "masterpiece," as so many label it, but its a good film. Maybe I still dont fully appreciate it. Now that I have it on DVD, I will be sure to watch it more times.',8,'23 August 2006','0017925');

	values('ur1002035','I watch a lot of short films and you can tell that Wes Anderson has very much made an impact on up and coming filmmakers due to how often you see people trying to make what they call a Wes Anderson style film. Watching these film is mostly interesting because of how often these efforts fall short. It is a reminder to me of how hard it actually is to do whimsy. To make it work, you not only need to make it happen, but you also need to do it in a way that gets the audience into the space they need to be in so as to be able to enjoy it; without this it is often just annoying.I was thinking of this because GBH is a great example of this working. This is not to say it is brilliant cinema, because in the end it is a whimsical piece but it does do it really well. The structure itself tells you where you are, because this is a film that opens with a girl paying respects at the bust of a dead author, who we then jump to as he starts to tell the story that was told to him by another man Â a story which is also that of a story being told Â and it is this story which we see for the most part. It is a structure that allows for the exaggeration and elaboration of all told stories, and it allows us to go with the sheer silliness of the tale. I say silliness, but actually the film keeps a lot which actually engages in the adventure plot, but yet at the same time delivers enough decadence and invention to allow us to enjoy it as a piece of fun.The cast match this. In many films it would be a real distraction to have so many famous faces in one film, however here it works Â again because the audience are mostly positioned just to go with whatever. Fiennes is the beating heart of the film, and if he does not make his character work then the whole thing would struggle; as it is, he makes it work really well, with such color and flourish. Revolori is equally good, and needs to be since the friendship and his link to the presence (or plural) is also critical to making it work. The rest of the cast contain so many famous names doing small but enjoyable turns that it is pointless to name them all Â but they all add to the whimsy rather than overwhelm it. Technically the film is a beauty, with great shots, great design through, and a sense of second-hand wonder which fits the story-telling structure.All told, it is a quite wonderful piece of silly adventure. It works because it knows itself, and it delivers itself really well in a way that draws the viewer into the space we need to be in to really go with it. This is not easy to do, and Anderson does it really well here.',0,'6 March 2016','2278388');

	values('ur20552756','Considering the cast, the critical acclaim and accolades The Deer Hunter garnered, and still does garner, part of me was expecting much more. It is a long way from a bad film, in fact its good and often very impressive, but its also uneven in places.The Deer Hunter is by some way director Michael Ciminos best film, and it contains his best ever directing. Thats saying a good deal, considering that only a few years later he would go on to direct the notorious flop Heavens Gate and his career never really recovered. The Deer Hunter is considered by some one of the finest Vietnam films (dont quite agree, to me there are far better examples), but it is also perhaps the most controversial. Either viewpoint is very easy to understand.Despite its many impressive, outstanding even, elements, The Deer Hunter is uneven. It is a bit too long (and no before anybody sneers, there have been films of similar length and even longer that still manage to be great films, a few among the best ever made), and would have been solved by tighter editing and a little less time on the lengthy wedding sequence, which is compelling with some strong character development but could easily have been trimmed.Parts are disjointed too, with some abrupt scene shifts and a heavy-handed patriotic ending that felt incredibly tacky against the rest of the film. There are deficiencies in the sound quality on top of all this.On the other hand, editing aside, The Deer Hunter is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography is quite magnificent and the attention to detail in the settings and the rest of the production both sumptuous and rich in atmosphere, the authenticity also remarkable. The music haunts the mind and is very beautiful, the mournful guitar theme unforgettable.Cimino is at his best in the directors chair, while the script provokes thought and the story is often incredibly powerful and moving. The highlight is the justly acclaimed Russian Roulette sequence, which today is genuinely harrowing and will stay with you forever.Robert De Niro has seldom been more restrained and gives an affecting performance. Even better is Christopher Walken, who has never reduced me to tears before and he really wrenches the heart here, making his character a compellingly real one and the most relatable one. John Savage, John Cazale (in his last film before his ultimely death) and a young Meryl Streep are sterling in support.In summary, uneven film but often very impressive with much to admire. 7/10 Bethany Cox',7,'4 July 2017','0077416');

	values('ur20748638','"Le Salaire de le Peur" ("The Wages of Fear") is a harrowing journey of four men going down in bumpy roads, miserable places, won over by the most difficult obstacles, a long way performing their jobs transporting a great load of dynamite to be used on a burning oil well. Its a job, it pays well, those guys are the best in it but its a hard, dangerous and exhausting service that can cost their lives. All the way, almost like descending to hell. This is the road to hell. Its a story about the battle between courage and cowardice and how fear can take over even the bravest of souls. This is Henri-Georges Clouzot masterpiece along with the equally brilliant "Les Diaboliques", both featuring a tension that rises into an endless crescent that never leaves you at ease.I saw "Sorcerer" (the American remake), read Georges Arnauds novel and watched this film. To me, they all stand on the same level. Theyre incredibly good, very exciting but theyre not great. Arnaud focus more on the missions perils rather than the characters and sometimes the story doesnt turn to other interesting possibilities; neither Clouzot or Friedkin films are the book, lacking of some of its good ideas but developing some new ones."Sorcerer" is an adventure about mercenaries looking for money and thrilling experiences while "The Wages of Fear" is a human drama about desperate people risking their lives to earn a living in the only possible way, and therefore more realistic than its remake. But Clouzot is a master in creating scary and real danger at practically every frame. A bar fight against local power man; the training closely observed by their patrons with conductors sabotaging each other; a truck making a difficult turn in a place that threats to collapse at any moment; the fear in the drivers eyes and hands, maneuvering as if each turn could be the last. The director delivers one of the most inspired and frightening moments of all time (not present in the book) when a giant stone stands on their way and the solution found to remove it to use part of the explosives. Heart couldnt handle very well that scene so perfectly made, with no soundtrack, very few dialogs and a constant action. And you relate very easily with the characters struggle, amazingly performed by Yves Montand (and I could never imagine him in such role, one of his earliest), Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck and Folco Lulli, similar in being all afraid of what theyre doing but their fears are expressed in many different ways. Some panic, some control it, others disguise from time to time trying to look adventurous. The difficulties I had with this were the erratic and long introduction of each character, too many humored bits that werent so effective (those could have been easily trimmed down) and the ending - not in the sense of being a let down but its goofy presentation seems awkward. The treatment given to the theme, the heart of the matter which is their mission and the rest (even the romance involving Montand and the girl, which is slightly distractive but useful) achieves a positive result. Certainly a movie of a different level and exciting even today. 21st Century flicks can only aspire to be something like this. Call me crazy, but Hollywood can even try again with a remake but this time read the novel, make wise choices and you might reach something similar or better. Theres themes that can be explored in a very interesting way to make it a more challengeable film and adventurous. 9/10',9,'5 September 2013','0046268');

Considering how politics has even further degenerated since 1939, even more relevant today than when it was released in 1939.Clever, engaging plot that doesnt waiver for a second. Not an ounce of deadwood in the movie - every scene is perfect and important. Some great twists and turns and some great tension towards the end as Smith struggles to preserve his name and ideals. Wonderful themes and morals too, as you would expect from Frank Capra.Add in some excellent performances, especially from James Stewart in the lead role and Jean Arthur as Ms Saunders. Both received Oscar nominations, as did Harry Carey for playing the President of the Senate.In all, Mr Smith Goes To Washington was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, but won only one, for best original screenplay. Unfortunately for it, the 1940 Oscars belonged to a juggernaut known as Gone With The Wind...',10,'22 April 2017','0031679');

	values('ur4716150','At only 45min., this silent comedy isnt that much longer than some 3 reel comedy shorts, yet, it apparently qualifies as a feature-length film. I dont see this film as being greatly superior to the many Keaton comedy shorts Ive seen. .......It starts out very slow, with Keaton and his girl sitting together for an eternity, not knowing what to say to the other. Finally, Keaton gives her a cheap engagement ring. Keaton is a mere movie projectionist, who dreams of becoming a detective in the class of Sherlock Holmes........I thought the $1.00 bill caper was cute, if unrealistic. Keaton wants to buy a $3. box of candy for his girl, but he only has $2. Luckily, he finds a $1 bill in his sweepings, also being the theater janitor. Unluckily, a women comes, complaining she lost a $1 bill in the theater, and he gives it to her. Then, another woman shows up claiming she also lost a $1 bill in the theater. Keston gives her his $1 bill. Then a mean-looking man shows up wanting to look through his sweepings. Keaton hands him his last $1. bill, but he refuses. Looking through the trash, he spies a wallet with some greenbacks in it, and goes off with it. Keaton then spreads the trash out, looking for another wallet. But, of course, he doesnt find such. Thus, he goes to the store, and buys the $1. box of candy. However, he converts the $1. price tag into a $4, to impress his girl. But, this deception will return to haunt him........While Keaton is talking to his girl, his competitor(villain) , in the form of Ward Crane, arrives, in a splendid outfit, and bringing a bigger box of candy, as well as a more impressive engagement ring. Keaton is relegated to the hall. Soon, the girls father reports that his gold watch is missing. The Villain slips the receipt for the watch he hocked at the pawn shop into Keatons jacket pocket. Then, Keaton says he will act as a detective, and search every one. The Villain requests him to also search himself, and he finds the pawn receipt, which says $4 for the watch., which matches the $4 price tag on the candy box. Keaton is requested by the girls father to leave and never return. ........Still imagining himself to be a detective, Keaton shadows The Villain, as the most likely suspect, in his mind. Eventually, he winds up in a boxcar, locked in by The Villain. Luckily, there is a hatch in thr roof. Just then, the train pulls out of the station. Keaton runs along the top of the cars to keep him near the water tower. When he runs out of cars, he jumps onto the tower dispenser, which lowers and begins to release water, which practically drowns Keaton(Keaton suffered a serious neck injury in this event.) . He then runs back to his projectionist job, where he soon dozes off.......Meanwhile, his girl goes to the pawn shop with the receipt and asks the pawnbroker what the man who traded the watch looked like. He was tall and had a black moustache, which fit the description of The Villain, but not Keaton. She was satisfied that Keaton was telling the truth that he knew nothing about the watch pawning........Some reviewers say they are confused which events take place in his upcoming dream, and which really happened. According to my notes, the dream begins about the 20min. mark and lasts until the 41min. mark, just a few minutes before the ending. Among other things, Keaton dreams he walks into the movie sceen and interacts a bit with the actors. Then, he is thrust into various odd or dangerous situations, in which his pose at the end of one situation carries over to the beginning of the next situation. ......He dreams that the Villain steals a pearl necklace from his girls mother. He takes this to a shack where his confederate thieves hideout. Keaton shows up at the hideout. Initially, captured, he breaks loose, and grabs the pearls The Villain is dangling before him, and runs.........The next gag has Keaton cornered in an alley by several of the gang. He jumps into the belly of a tie salesman, standing behind him and disappears. The gang finally find him hiding behind a rotating section of the wood fence behind. He runs, and the gang chases him. A cop on a motorcycle appears and invites him to ride on his handlebars. Soon, the cop is bumped off, without Keaton knowing it, and the cycle negotiates around various obstacles without Keatons help, until it comes to the shack where Keatons girl is being held, where it rockets him into the shack, he hitting the guard. Soon, the gang arrives in a car. They trick the gang, and take their car, which ends up in a lake: just the top part, which sails a ways before sinking. Keaton wakes up, and his girl arrives to tell him she believes him innocent of stealing the watch.. The movie on the screen is about to end, with the man hugging and kissing the woman. Keaton imitates what they do on the screen , with his girl. The end.',7,'3 October 2018','0015324');

The two local detectives, quickly grab up a mentally challenged kid from the village. It was known that the lad liked the one victim.The two detectives administer some rather forceful third degree to the lad. They then get the lad to record a scripted confession. The case is solved and the two are local heroes.That is, till, a detective sent from Seoul arrives. This detective goes over everything and realizes the boy is not guilty. The boy is released and the local cops are less than amused with the new cop on the block.The new guy quickly shows his stuff though by going over the evidence and finding more victims. The local boys again grab up the first suspect for some country justice. Of course they are a bit too quick off the mark and this man is also innocent. The pace picks up steam as more women are added to the victim list. A woman cop helps out by pointing out all the murders happen on rainy nights, and when a certain song on the radio is played that same night.The net is thrown wider and a girl who survived an attack is located. Off her somewhat cloudy description, a new suspect is rounded up. This time the locals do not resort to the "in your face" interview tactics. They do not want anything that could foul up the court case. The man though does not break, and is set free. The police do however have people tail the suspect.There is a mix-up with the assignments and the tail is lost. Another dead girl is the result. On this victim there is a small bit of DNA evidence not ruined by the rain. This is sent off to the States for the FBI to examine.The evidence comes back as inconclusive. The Seoul detective knows they have the right man no matter what the evidence says. Now he goes off the dead end, he intends to kill the suspect. Does he?

	values('ur0453068','Id like to imagine that if Luis Bunuels grandson (or maybe grand-daughter, who knows) had the same temperament and filmmaking go-for-broke sense of death-defying comedic satire, and grew up on a diet of Tarantino scripts, he/she might make something like Wild Tales. Or perhaps theres also a touch of Kafka to some of this - people who are put into completely insane situations that start from something typical (a guy who flips off or a guy getting flipped off while driving, or a guy getting his car towed), or not so much (a grooms infidelity discovered by the bride right in the middle of the wedding reception, or a negotiation by rich men over how to save a kid from going to jail for running someone over).In either case, theres a totally bizarre streak that is aimed largely at people who are pretty well off, and the violent, rather macabre circumstances that occur to them. Theres no connecting characters from one short to the next, unlike some anthology films out there, but its certainly a film that connects the threads together like a book of short stories does. Its almost the kind of film I dont want to tell you too much about before you see it; I knew relatively little except that it had been up for the Golden Palm and an Oscar a year or so ago, and that it was produced by Pedro Almodovar (and for the latter, he rarely produces outside of his own work, so it must mean something major).I can tell you that all but one of the shorts is astonishingly good ("The Deal" is the one that is just alright, though it still is well directed and acted, with an interesting conclusion, just not the strongest narrative thrust - the one short that mightve worked better as a scene in another, full feature film). If theres another connecting thread its that the stories feature escalation of some kind from one small thing into something that mushrooms. This is highlighted most by a scene involving two motorists, which makes, for lack of a better comparison, Duel look like kids playing with toys as far as brutal mania goes.Its not like things go crazy right off; the shell of civilization and often having to be proper in a setting is highlighted, like at a DMV or at a wedding or on an airplane or even as simple as serving someone in a small town diner. Some of the characterizations are certainly nuts for some of the people, but thats part of the fun for me. Seeing the screws turned by the filmmaker, DamiÃ¡n SzifrÃ³n, is a real joy and theres a sense of inspiration from one episode to the next - how will can things really get? A lot of this is genuinely unexpected, and its more-so based on behavior (again, a good number of the characters here are well-dressed, upper-middle class, again the sort of figures Bunuel went after from time to time, though minus the religious side of things).But more than anything its about something which is ripe for the darkest comedy (though an undercurrent of severity runs in it) and it also comes down to revenge, which is usually enough incentive to find humor in the greatest of human disasters (especially, most so, when they go kind of really wrong). While you can read a lot into the satire of it all, that this figure or that or this institution does this or this other one is broken (marriage, the legal system, the bureaucracy, simply flipping someone off), its almost best to look at this as a guy who is at a party and holding your undivided attention with a story that sounds too good to be true, but it is not, and then five times more. And as far as telling a damn good story, Id be inclined to say the Wedding segment, which ends the film, is by itself the best film of 2014.',9,'5 March 2016','3011894');

	values('ur0643062','Spoilers herein.Bergman is much loved because of his sheer passion, its intimate rawness and the ability to present it visually. He was able to sustain that uncomfortable ability for decades, but this film also has something else -- unique in his work -- a particularly complex narrative architecture.Ordinary stories are just there, with no recognition of being told: but those are remarkably uninteresting. Nearly everything worth reading, hearing or seeing has some sort of the recognition of telling, often by putting the telling explicitly in the story as in `Hamlet. Sometimes it gets turned on its head when the telling element becomes the focus, as in `Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.But here that notion of one fold in space becomes seven. The story we see is: a game, a collection of visions, a mural, a book of the Bible, a performance by players, an obsessive religious ritual, and the movie itself (the seventh seal). Each encapsulates the other. We have seven characters that advocate or represent each of these, apart from the `crusade of real life.This is so complex and so finely woven it changed the entire world. Everything that came after sees it as perhaps an unwelcome spectral visitor, perhaps a template (see `Ninth Gate), perhaps as a stack of parts from which one borrows. But everyone sees it and is changed.My favorite working filmmaker is Greenaway. He says of this, that when he saw it, he knew he had to be a filmmaker. I believe most of us who actually see this will be similarly changed. Bergman was never able to weave as fine a narrative lace again.',0,'30 April 2002','0050976');

What I did do before I settled down to watch it, was look at the rating on IMDb. 8.6 out of 10!! This must be great, like many other reviewers, I believe my low rating is a reaction to the absolute travesty that many movies are being rated so highly. The original Mad Max movies had a young and charismatic, unknown Australian actor called Mel Gibson in them. They had some plot and believability. This had so much money thrown at it, supposedly around $150 million, that the whole world view of Mad Max was gone. Hundreds of vehicles driving around in the desert. A community of thousands, with clearly no problem with water or food, even though the baddie turns on the water and lets in pour into the sand and then turns it off, and tells his people not to become addicted to water ??? Words are failing me, to describe how badly I feel. Any young people out there reading this, should watch Mad Max 1-2, skip the Hollywood version, thunderdome. Honestly, once again left speechless with the true awfulness of this film.',1,'24 June 2015','1392190');

A beautiful, funny and touching story that delivers on all fronts of meaningful film-making.In comparable style to Wallace and Gromit, the film uses its charming and silly style to great effect by relating two unique characters. A middle-aged man with social disabilites named Max Jerry Horovitz receives a letter one day from an inquisitive little Australian girl named Mary Daisy Dinkle. The two via letters relate to one another instantly, and an amazing bond of friendship begins.About 2 hours ago I finished watching this flick and Im still beaming.

From the jaw-dropping visuals beautifully rendered in 3D, to the flawless animation of the characters and dragons, this was one film that didnt disappoint.Our protagonist is Hiccup, a boy viking who doesnt possess much in common with his dragon slaying dad. However, when he finds a new friend in Toothless, the most feared dragon of its species, he learns that dragons are not the fearful creatures he was brought up to believe.What I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless the dragon. This was dealt with wonderfully and we see their relationship develop over a series of scenes which were done with great humour and action.The 3D holds its own in every sense, and I would go as far as saying that some scenes rival the groundbreaking Avatar. The scenes that especially stood out were the flying segments where the dragon soars over crystal clear seas and jaw-dropping backdrops.Whilst this is a film that may seem as if its solely directed at the younger generation, its stunning visuals and well-told story means that it will keep any adult satisfied.',8,'14 March 2010','0892769');

Soon The Dude must try and figure out whos pulling all the strings but of course in between his bowling league and dope. The "plot" of THE BIG LEBOWSKI is probably the least important thing because as a mystery it really doesnt work for a couple reasons. One is that its too easy to figure out what really happened and the second is that you really dont care too much. The movie works because of the terrific characters and I dont think its an overstatement to say that theyre some of the most memorable of any film of the decade. The screenplay by the Coen brothers works so well because the characters are so well developed and theyve gotten some incredibly talented actors to bring them to life. Even the smallest parts in the film feature a fair number of known actors including a few who would go onto win Oscars. The entire film goes around Bridges who is pitch-perfect as The Dude. This laid back type of character is one Bridges had been playing for decades by this point but add in the dope, the strange dialogue and the supporting characters and you can say youve never seen a lazy bum like this one. Bridges is just so believable in the part that you not once feel as if youre seeing a performance but instead youre seeing a real loser caught up in the situation. John Goodman plays his Vietnam buddy and its a real shame that he gets so overlooked because he delivers perhaps the funniest performance in the film. Countless movies have done the "crazed Vietnam" bit to death but Goodman comes across so original that you cant help but feel that hes one of the best who has ever done it. I just love the way hes able to go from calm to psycho and back to calm in the matter of seconds. The supporting cast is just as impressive with Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, Tara Reid, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro are all terrific in their bit parts as well. The chemistry that the supporting players have with Bridges is another strong selling point. Another major plus is the soundtrack, which features the likes of Bob Dylan, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Costello, Santana, the Eagles and many more. I think the one downside to the film is that since the mystery doesnt work, the extended 117-minute running time feels a bit too long and you cant help but feel that the story could have been wrapped up in less time. With that said, there are countless big laughs to be had here and its certainly true that you never know where the comedy is going to come from and that helps keep the thing moving. The performances, especially Bridges and Goodman, makes this film a true cult classic.',0,'24 June 2011','0118715');

	values('ur0482513','Twenty-five years after it was first released, Spielbergs timeless classic still hasnt aged a day and retains that chilling suspense and tension which first propelled it into the limelight in the first place. A masterpiece in fear and terror, this is an expertly-crafted film (everything about it is just right: the pacing, the story, the acting, the cinematography) packed with believable, realistic characters who you know and care about, and plenty of nail-biting moments and scares. It also boasts an incredible last fifty minutes, which is basically a cat and mouse game between Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw and the Great White itself.At first, the film introduces us to the main characters, showing them investigating and sometimes floundering about, unsure of what action to take. The scenes of victims getting pulled under the waves are occasionally gruesome and quite terrifying, especially for a non-swimmer such as myself. As the attacks grow more frequent there are lots of those scenes of people panicking which PIRANHA spoofed so mercilessly. All this is in line with the classic ominous music which quite rightly won an Oscar and gives the film that extra suspense. Having watched this film as a child, I can verify that there is one cheap shock which scared the heck out of me when I was younger. It involves Dreyfess investigating an abandoned ship. As he examines the hull underwater, all of a sudden a white head pops out of a hole, one of the eyes eaten away by fish. This alone helped me to have loads of nightmares and, seen today, its still pretty disturbing.The final hour ups the film a notch into classic status. Essentially it becomes a three-hander, and Spielberg piles on the tense atmosphere. A lot of the film plays on our fear of the unknown, giving us brief glimpses of the shark but nothing more. Im not surprised that this film put people off swimming in the ocean. Thankfully when the shark does make itself seen at the end, the giant model used is pretty good (for the time) and pretty menacing. Only one shot, of it rearing up against the boat, looks false. Other scenes of it gliding just under the waters surface are terrific.The acting from the three main cast members is excellent, all three men are as good as each other in a different way. A hairy Richard Dreyfess is the likable, slightly clumsy marine biologist, while Roy Scheider is the tough police chief who you wouldnt like to mess with. We dont really learn a lot about his character except that hes honest, fair, and above all else a family man. And thats enough for us, to know that hes a decent character who will inevitably win out against the menace at the end. However, I would say that the superb mannered turn from Robert Shaw as the ships captain is the highlight of the film. Shaw instils his character with a kind of gruff charm that makes it impossible not to like him.In the final half an hour, the isolated ship starts taking in water and slowly sinks, while the shark plays with the humans on board and the waters keep getting redder and redder with blood. The action-packed finale is truly nail-biting and, I would say, one of the best endings in a film ever. All of this and more helps JAWS to remain the final word in underwater horror. Suffice to say, a handful of lesser imitations followed, author/screenwriter Peter Benchley spent the rest of his life rewriting the same kind of tale and the three sequels got progressively worse.',10,'8 August 2016','0073195');

Suffice to say that, thanks to great performances by everyone (not only Robin Williams, but also by Ethan Hawke in his debut, former Hitchcock movies supporting player Norman Lloyd and Robert Sean Leonard as a fellow student), nice cinematography, good soundtrack and a great message (the one of making your life extraordinary) this is truly a classic that has to be seen at least once.

I cannot find a better statement for this miracle of a silent masterpiece. What has been mastered here is a view, taken from historical record, and put under a microscope figuratively and literally on screen to dive into the spiritual essence of destiny. This film is in a class by itself, and had a profound impact on this viewer.The film begins during the 100 Years War in France. In its battle against its enemy England, a commoner rose through the ranks to lead France to many great victories. This great warrior was peasant girl Joan of Arc, not even 18 years old but commanded a presence among her peers and a reputation impressed upon her enemies. Joan has been promised French deliverance from the mouth of God himself. Captured and put on what is essentially a mock trial for the whole film (she would have most likely been executed anyway) she must stand firm against the cacophony of priests who at first spit at her and call her a demon who cries blasphemy. Soon however, when she is given the chance to free herself at the expense of her devout belief in God and refuses, the film becomes a tragedy of the rest form, a good person making the ultimate sacrifice to something bigger than anyone in this film can possibly imagine. The mastery of this films narrative is in its reliance on the extreme close-up, which i can only estimate takes up 95% of the film. Director Dryer and cinematographer Rudolf Mate take a radical approach to the film, which has stood the test of time as one of the most daring films ever made. Joans face as well as the other characters fill the frame, and what was not normal for the silent films, the actors do not wear any make-up at all. What this gives is confinement in the audience, as wee are as locked in this small blank room as Joan is, thus helping us feel the emotions of the scenes and care for the main character in a unique way. We cannot look away from the faces, especially that of Joans astonishingly beautiful eyes.What stands out in this film is the central performance of Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. When she enters the picture, she does not look like a common heroine. She has short hair, no make-up, and no soft lighting to make her "gorgeous." In this way, Falconetti must communicate a visceral reaction and emotions through her facial expressions, and since she is always in close-up, this cannot escape and she cannot cheat. With this said, this is a truly flawless performance, in fact one of the greatest films I have ever seen in Cinema history. When she does stumble and ultimately does the "morally right" thing, I broke down in tears, quite rarely have I ever had so much respect and heartbreak over a person I never knew. This is a bravura performance that I cannot praise enough.The Passion of Joan of Arc is a miracle, and when given again the fact that it was made in the 1920s, this is even more astonishing. Please see this film and judge for yourself.Note: I am sorry I havent written in a long time. College and work is murder and time must be put elsewhere quite a lot. But I intend to write more and this film helped me rekindle the flame that git me to doing this in the first place - Theflyace"',10,'5 May 2017','0019254');

	values('ur20862145','I first watched Tokyo Story in a classroom some time ago and witnessed something curious. I have never seen a group of people so choked up over a film, ever. The most curious thing about it though is that most could not place what exactly made them so emotional. There are moments in Tokyo Story in which you are hit with a wall of emotions, surprised and overwhelmed that this simple little film could evoke such feelings. Its something about the characters, the honesty, the way everything hits home despite the cultural and time-period barriers.Tokyo Story takes a deep look at familial relations in postwar Japan. Simply, it boils down to this: two aging parents (played by Ryu Chishu and Higashiyama Chieko) live far away from their children, who are in a quickly modernizing Tokyo. The children in Tokyo are quite selfish and focused on their own busy lives in the hustle-and-bustle of the city. The key character in this film, though, is Noriko (Hara Setsuko), the widow of one of the parents sons who died in the war. Noriko turns out to be more active with her husbands parents than their own children are.The parents decide to make their first, and possibly final, trip to Tokyo in order to see their children and view the spectacle of the city. The only person that can make significant time for them, however, is Noriko; the children are busy with work and even send their parents away to a spa! In one heartfelt scene, the mother, Tomi, spends the night at Norikos in which she begs her to re-marry and apologizes for the burden that her son has caused. During this time, the father, Shukichi, is out drinking with old friends and admits to them that he is disappointed with his children, agreeing with his friends who feel the same way.Ozu Yasujiro is considered to be one of the worlds greatest filmmakers and Tokyo Story is considered his masterpiece. There is no reason to deny this. Ozus camera is often a topic of discussionÂit usually sets itself at the level of people sitting on the floor (tatami), which allows the viewer to feel like they are sitting right with the characters. It is usually always a calm camera, and very rarely pans. His films are also often slowly paced and meditative, choosing to avoid showing important events which later are revealed through dialogue. Ozus direction of children has always been brilliant, they are never a weak point in his films and he often bases his stories on child characters (though not here).Tokyo Story contains all of the elements that make Ozus films popular with film students and cinephiles today. His calm, observant camera; his real-life, non-embellished characters; his attention to detail and the emotional emphasis on certain objects; his perfectly timed music; among other things, contribute ultimately to the warmth and effectiveness of the film. Ozus passion for filmmaking knew no bounds.Tokyo Story will not appeal to everybody, especially today. The typical moviegoer will either dismiss the film because it is "old" or "black and white," or find it boring. To the cautious and attentive viewers who allow themselves to connect with the characters and feel the story, Tokyo Story is a rewarding experience. Tokyo Story, along with Ozus other films, is a good example of film as an art. Aimed at telling a story and depicting true life on camera, it is much less of the "entertainment" experience that people have come to expect from the movies today. There are no explosions, violence, chase scenes, or over- the-top characters here. This is Ozu. This is one of the greatest films ever made.',10,'20 July 2010','0046438');

The division of two groups, the tutsis and the hutus,made Rwandas peace something to dream about. We see that all started when the Belgians gave power to the tustsis, because they had a fair skin and a complexion much more similar of the Europeans then the hutus. Even measuring the noses was a normal thing to do. Years after, the Hutus were the ones who stayed with the power and they wanted revenge by smashing the tutsis.This movie shows the history of a man called Paul Rusesabagina and his courage during the war in Rwanda, when he saved the lives of over a thousand helpless tutsi refugees from a big genocide. Paul is a hutu, but his family is tutsi, another reason to have experienced the terrible things the hutus were doing to the tutsis.Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo are both awesome in their roles, and Don should have won the best actor award/Nobel.Ps: Jean Renos cameo here.',9,'10 June 2006','0395169');

He depends on other to kind of look out for him. Unfortunately, he has worked with crooks because its the only living he knows. He does hard manual labor. He likes to box and because he is intense, he catches the eye of the world champion. He gets a gig as a sparring partner and eventually a fight with the champ, Apollo Creed. Of course, its a circus. Because Rocky is not bright, Creed is able to abuse him emotionally. Rocky is a bruiser, taking as many hits as he gives. Not a good way to have a future. There are subplots, involving MIck (Burgess Meredith) and Pauley (who is disrespectful of his sister Adrian) and then there is the romance developing between Rocky and Adrian. What happens is that Creed thinks Rocky is a joke while Rocky begins to train seriously for the first time in his life. What eventually happens is one of the best choreographed fights in all of cinematic history. A masterful movie.',10,'20 December 2016','0075148');

It takes a truly skilled director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense.

	values('ur26777495','Without question, this was Hugh Jackmans movie, from start to finish. No matter how you view it, or who the mantle is passed onto next, Jackman will forever be Wolverine, and this film proves it once and for all. Logan dives deep into the hearts of its viewers, twisting and turning until every emotional string is pulled, and in the end, delivers a superhero film like no other before it; a perfect swan song.Logan heavily, and fittingly, borrows from Marvels iconic Old Man Logan comic to tell the story of a grim and desolate future, where mutant-kind is all but extinct. Director/writer James Mangold was finally given all the tools necessary to tell a truly compelling Wolverine story, and arguably the biggest tool in the box was the R rating. It pushes the film into an extremely dark and forbidding tone, which helps carve the movie into one of immense intensity and emotion. The R rating, of course, also allows for studious amounts of gore and profanity, but those elements dont feel like they were added just because they could be, they only added to the atmosphere Mangold created for this film, and in turn helps set the narrative to be nothing short of enthralling. The pacing is spot on, the dialogue is stellar and the emotional weight is that of a moving mountain. I applaud Mangold for his brilliant writing, and subsequent directing, as he was at last able to produce the Wolverine story every fan has been craving for the last 17 years, one of raw emotion, brutality and pure magnificence.Hugh Jackman has devoted the last 17 years of his career to this beloved character, and now, he leaves it all on the table, giving the performance of a lifetime, one which could seriously garner some looks at an Oscar nomination. The writing of the characters, Wolverine specifically, stand out the most in the gritty setting, because few superhero movies have ever done what Logan is able to do; make the characters vulnerable, make them real and to make you truly care like never before. Wolverine is worn down and beaten, looking for a way out, and Hugh Jackman gives you every reason to want to feel for his character. His action scenes are nothing short of powerful, none more than his final, and the emotion he displays in every aspect is worthy of an award-winning performance. I genuinely cannot express my praise for Jackman enough, he gave it is all.Wolverine is accompanied by two spectacular supporting characters for most of the film in franchise favorite Professor X and the ferocious X-23. Both characters add tremendous layers of depth to both Wolverine and the film as a whole, with exceptional performances from Patrick Stewart and youngster Dafne Keen, whos X- 23 is an absolute showstopper. The main villain, Pierce, isnt anything too special, but doesnt have to be in a story like this. The core cast of Wolvie, Professor X and X-23 are what drive the film and the performances by their respective actors are outstanding. The father figure that Professor X is to Wolverine and the subsequent father that Wolverine is to X-23 is a deep, touching addition to their characters. This is no-doubt a character driven film, and with Wolverine in the drivers seat, and a pair of dynamite supporting characters, the ability to connect with these characters is real, and that is a treasure few superhero films have ever held.The films action is gloriously vicious, showcasing what a hacking from Wolverine or X-23 would actually look like. But its not just the heavy amounts of gore that make the action so amazing, its again the feeling that these characters are in true danger and every move they make could cost them their lives, none more than Wolverine himself, whose reduced healing factor forces him into a different mindset that, outside of briefly in "The Wolverine", weve never seen before. Hes not invincible, and even with X-23s relentless attacks, he still has to play his cards differently, and it translates into an emotional roller coaster. All together the action sequences and sheer amount of violence were a sight to behold, entertaining and fierce.17 years it has been, since we first watched a young Hugh Jackman don his X-Men suit. 17 years of stories, character development, action, hardship, humor and emotion, come together to deliver one final journey. The final scene alone may move you to tears, as Hugh Jackmans time as the iconic Wolverine comes to an end. One final epic masterpiece of superhero cinema; Logan.10/10',10,'4 June 2017','3315342');

From the standpoint of voice acting, it ranges from believable and unshowoffy (unlike the annoying star turns were seeing in a lot of these days) to the stentorian sneer of the great Peter OToole.And, most of all, the character creation and animation is beyond belief.

	values('ur2483625','In the world that author Paddy Chayefsky created for Network, there are in fact four television networks instead of the three that people from my generation grew up with. That fourth TV network is the United Broadcasting Systems or UBS for short. They are running a very poor fourth, especially in the news division. Their Walter Cronkite is one Howard Beale whos been slipping badly in the ratings. Beale played by Peter Finch is given the axe by his good friend, the director of the news division of UBS Max Schumacher who is played by William Holden.Beale who really has nothing else in his life, left a childless widower a few years earlier, but this program. He calmly announces that hes going to kill himself on the next broadcast.That sets in motion a chain of events in the network and in the company that owns the network and the holding company that owns the company that make Howard Beale the mad prophet of the air. Programmer Faye Dunaway decides to blend news and entertainment with a series of startling ideas. What hath Network wrought? In 1976 Network was considered clever way out satire. Now theres more truth in it than one would like to believe. Now we have television networks that are devoted to nothing but news, but strive for those all important ratings with blending entertainment with news.But Chayefsky missed the boat in two respects. He did not anticipate the rise of cable television. Whereas my generation grew up with three networks period, affordable cable has multiplied the networks into the hundreds. That in itself makes the four network reality of Network outdated. And of course Mr. Chayefsky did as so many others, not anticipate the Internet where so many people now get their information and its even a source of entertainment. Bill Holden and Peter Finch were nominated for their performances in the Best Actor category. They probably would have split the vote which is what normally happens, but for Peter Finchs demise before the Oscar voting. Sad to say that probably clinched the Oscar for him, but it was still well deserved. An honest decent man who gets caught up in machinations that end in tragedy, you dont take your eyes off Finch for one second while hes on screen.Holden is caught up in the machinations as well. He gets a midlife crisis and starts an affair with Faye Dunaway, but their differences in not only age, but general outlook on life drive them apart. Holdens left his wife Beatrice Straight for Dunaway and she got a Best Supporting Actress award for her scenes telling off Mr. Holden. Its by no means certain what Holdens future is, but it is clear he has no place in the television industry as it was constituted in 1996.Nor I doubt he would have one today in 2006. I can see Holdens character, a man now in his mid 80s being a professor emeritus of journalism at some college or even running a newsblog today. Robert Duvall, Wesley Addy, William Prince are all corporate types we find in various films about big business. The one character who stands out for me is Ned Beatty, the head of the conglomerate who bought the whole network. His scene with Peter Finch where he explains the facts of life to the now demented Howard Beale is the best in the film.Network is a great film, both entertaining and thought provoking.',9,'3 March 2006','0074958');

	values('ur5156288','Sean Penns Into the Wild is beautiful, staggering, thoughtful, a labor of love made by a filmmaker with real passion for the story he set out to tell. Like a Terrence Malick picture, Into the Wild transcends any conception such as "if you only see one film this year" and goes beyond the very notion of "Oscar-worthy". If one really has to say something on the subject, then Into the Wild should have shared the Best Picture award with No Country for Old Men, but that kind of thinking is besides the point because Penns masterpiece is more than a movie, or a work of art for that matter: its a life experience.A rebel at heart, Penn clearly identifies, at least on a few levels, with the films unconventional protagonist, a bright young boy named Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), whose astounding true story was first recounted in Jon Krakauers book which gives the picture its title. Christopher had it all: loving parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister (Jena Malone), excellent grades and a most promising future. Then, one fine day the 20-year old college graduate decided that wasnt really what he wanted, took his law school fund and disappeared, setting out for a journey to the heart of America. "Im going into the wild" the self-renamed Alex Supertramp wrote in his journal, and though he occasionally ran into people (Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and others) he would connect with in a deeper way, thats where he really belonged: away from civilization, just him, his elementary tools and the pure, untarnished nature surrounding him.Christophers journey, which is carried out with just the basic resources one needs to survive (no cell phone or other gadgets), is a modern odyssey of sorts, a quest for something that was lost forever and wont be found in the near future. In a world like ours, where technology rules all, a choice like Christophers would be met with disbelief and probably derision. That only heightens the intensity of the characters message, which is also what the director aims to tell us: we need to rediscover ourselves before its too late. It doesnt matter whether we are young or old, as the protagonist touchingly teaches an elderly man (Hal Holbrook, the only cast-member to be nominated for an Oscar), the important thing is we give it a serious try.To simply call this a film isnt enough: in one of the most amazing combinations of efforts in the history of movie-making, the story, Penns soulful direction, Hirschs painfully real performance (will he ever be this good again?) and Eddie Vedders elegiac songs (an essential soundtrack for any true film-lover) merge into something thats almost too powerful to describe in words: you have to see it to believe it.Into the Wild isnt an "easy" film: it will leave you very affected, possibly devastated, but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing a genuine masterwork. It will ignite real thoughts about life instead of the phony reflections so many "issue movies" try to induce. It will hit the gut, the heart and the mind in equal measure, and once the initial wave of emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded. Into the Wild does this because it isnt merely a motion picture: it is art, life, freedom and nature, all together in a mesmerizing piece of visual poetry.',10,'20 May 2008','0758758');

It has to be the best fantasy movie ever made.A twister sends Dorothy, her dog Toto and their home to the magical land of Oz. When there, she first discovers her home has crushed the Wicked Witch of the East to death and the area of Oz she has landed in is Munchkin Land. After a visit from the Good Witch of the North, some songs with the munchkins and an unpleasant visit from the Wicked Witch of the West, she starts to make her way along the Yellow Brick Road to the Emarald City to visit the Wizard himself who can get her back home to Kansas. On the way, she meets up with the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion and they eventually end up at the Emarald City. Before eventually meeting the Wizard, she is kidnapped by the Wicked Witch of the Wests strange monkey-bat creature slaves and locked up in her castle but is rescued and the Witch disintegrates when some water is thrown over her. Dorothy then gets to see the Wizard, who gives the Scarecrow his brain, the Tin Man his heart and the Cowardly Lion his courage. The Wizard turns out to be a Kansas person as well but his balloon is accidentally released and Dorothy misses out on returning home with him. She returns home by saying "Theres No Place Like Home" but all this turns out to be a dream at the end.The best song in the movie has to be "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", which Dorothy sings before she gets to Oz.Now to the excellent cast. Judy Garland plays her best role as Dorothy and is joined by Frank Morgan who has five roles, Burt Lahr, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and an excellent performance from Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West.This movie is an excellent way to spend part of an afternoon, not just at Christmas when most TV channels screen it. The VHS copy I own also features some extras, including one on the making of the move.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.',10,'24 January 2005','0032138');

	values('ur2707735','At the conclusion of my review for "Before Sunrise", I practically vowed I wouldnt be catching any of the sequels, but IMDb beckons with its Top #250 list (this one from #2015), so here I am again. I thought there might be a more mature handling of the now adult Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), but it seems like theyre still stuck in that awkward teenage stage of their lives. At least thats the case with the dialog that consumes most of the picture.I think Celine probably bothered me more this time around. Shes rather neurotic, and keeps asking Jesse if HE thinks shes neurotic, and she wont take no for an answer because shes like..., neurotic. Shes the first one again to insert the F word into their conversation, this time by way of the middle finger, and isnt it just perfect that she works for the Green Cross. And oh yes, she cant take Jesses compliment about her looks. Because he thinks her face looks skinnier, she launches into a self recriminating fatty diatribe. This kind of stuff wears me down, folks.And then the topper to blow Jesse out of the water - she cant even agree on whether they made love that night nine years ago. Turns out Celine laid that trip on Jesse because of her own insecurities, and wound up correcting her version later on, but its those kind of mind games that mess a guy up. And all the while its pretty transparent that Jesses not going to catch that plane because he keeps diverting his attention to the next step of the plan to get back together with her.I thought that long, long walk up the stairs pretty much captured the desire each was hoping for, the inevitable that would happen once they got to Celines apartment. The story ended in just the right way for me, with that ambiguity hanging out there even though Jesse telegraphed what was going to happen by stating he didnt much care about taking his plane home. And so it comes to the point where I have to implore IMDb reviewers, please, please dont make me watch "Before Midnight" with a rating that makes it a top movie favorite. One more time would be just too much, I have no desire to find out what happened with these two star crossed lovebirds.',7,'7 December 2017','0381681');

	values('ur28159509','Only with the passage of time and an increased sense of awareness can I now see a remarkable movie like "Groundhog Day" for what it is. The last time I watched it, and that was some time ago, I mostly saw an engaging comedy / drama / fantasy with moments both funny and sobering. Now, I can look at it and see what a thoughtful piece of work it is. It is true that its the kind of movie that really does benefit from repeat viewings.Bill Murray makes the most of a weighty role as Phil Connors, egocentric, wise ass weatherman who travels to the Pennsylvania community of Punsxutawney to cover its annual Groundhog Day ceremony. A blizzard confines him to the town - a blizzard he failed to predict accurately - and while there he realizes hes trapped in a time loop; Groundhog Day repeats itself over and over, to the point where Phil becomes aware of practically every event that will occur. By turns, Phil is both ecstatic - if theres no tomorrow, he doesnt have to worry about the consequences of his actions, and he engages in some great comic bits of recklessness - and despondent, when his attempts to use his knowledge for self gain go awry. Only after some efforts to come to grips with the course of events does he realize the power of any human beings thoughts and actions, as he has the ability to be there for other people and even save their lives.Murray is great, whether hes being introspective, rascally / charming, or saddened. Andie MacDowell provides an appealing love interest as Rita, the terminally chipper producer to whom he realizes hes becoming attracted. A supporting cast of familiar faces also helps: Chris Elliott as the cameraman, Stephen Tobolowsky (in his best known role) as aggressive insurance salesman Ned Ryerson, Bills older brother Brian Doyle- Murray as "groundhog honcho" Buster Green, comedians Rick Ducommun and Rick Overton as scruffy locals, Robin Duke as the diner waitress, and, in his film debut, a young Michael Shannon as a guy getting married.Director / co-writer Harold Ramis, making a cameo as a local neurologist, keeps things headed in clever directions (its a delicious bit of dark comedy when Phil tries various means of suicide in his attempts to end the cycle), always successfully alternating between the laughs and the more touching elements. In fact, "Groundhog Day" is simply very sweet as Phil develops more of an interest in an old homeless mans welfare and becomes increasingly attached to Rita. And George Fentons music always hits just the right notes for any given scene. In short, its one of the stars best ever vehicles and a consistently entertaining movie worth revisiting.10 out of 10.',10,'2 February 2012','0107048');

Cobb: Terrifying masterpiece based on the book by William Peter Blatty. There are many Biblical accounts where Jesus himself drove demons out of people, so an exorcist is obviously someone who rids what doesnt belong. Ellen Burstyn stars as an actress whose daughter is possessed by demonic forces. After the shocking image of her daughter screaming atop a shaking bed, she seeks professional help. When doctors fail in finding answers it is suggested that a Priest see the girl. Intelligent, shocking with a sense of insight where Burstyn asks the right questions regarding exorcism. Quite an accomplishment for director William Friedkin who previously made another masterpiece in The French Connection. Burstyn brilliantly mirrors frustration mixed with fear. Linda Blair is both sympathetic and commanding as the possessed victim. Jason Miller plays a troubled Priest whom questions his faith after his mothers death. Lee J. Cobb steals moments as a police inspector. Then there is Max Von Sydow is compelling as the exorcist who sensed the demonic force in the films opening and ultimately understands the standoff he will eventually face.

	values('ur0384847','Thirty years prior to THE DEER HUNTER came this movie, an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the American family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives. A truly ironic title, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved.Truly an ensemble cast despite the top-billing of Myrna Loy, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES focuses more on the stories of the men. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, upon returning, cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to Marie, a happy-go-lucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him. Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world -- including the girl he loves and her family -- thinks he is a freak of nature.At almost three hours of length, the film never seems long and drawn out. There is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by; nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing. Not a performance rings false, though the standouts are those of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even then every character has his or her moment on film, and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in American films (including the ones made around World War One, which did not dabble in such topics). While there is never any overt violence, its all there, in the haunted expressions of the three male leads faces, in the lot where the planes now reside, ready to be turned into junk (and therefore, forgetfulness), in the cynicism of the store owners who couldnt be bothered to employ these shell-shocked men who had seen battle or even worse, to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for. This is the film in which COMING HOME and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY are indebted to. At a time when America fled from war films, to come up with this when the end of the Second World War was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest film-making.',10,'18 December 2005','0036868');

I dont know if I should be comforted or disturbed that the events depicted in Gillo Pontecorvos film so closely mirror those going on in the Middle East right now. On the one hand, its comforting to realize that events and tensions that seem scary in the present day have been going on virtually forever, and that every generation has probably thought at some point that the world they lived in represented the human race at its lowest point. But on the other hand, its disturbing to think that the same patterns have been repeating themselves for ages and we as a race just keep making the same blunders over and over again."The Battle of Algiers" chronicles in near documentary fashion the struggle of the Algerian Muslims against the imperialist French rule in the 1950s. Overwhelmed by the might and resources of the French military, a rebel group of Algerians resort to terrorist tactics to make themselves heard. Stuck in the middle are the everyday Algerian and French citizens, who die in bombings and attacks perpetrated by both sides, and are fed propaganda explaining how each side is working in their best interests.Theres a scene mid-way through the film in which a French military commander lectures a gathering on the personalities and philosophies of terrorist cells. He explains the terrorist cell structure, and how the best way to kill the cell is to cut off its head. Sound familiar? Pontecorvos film is engrossing, and one that will always (sadly) be relevant. His sympathies obviously reside with the Algerians -- the film ends with images of an Algerian uprising that occurred two years after the main events depicted in the movie, with Algerian people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and shouting cries of "freedom," "liberty" and such. But we do see the human cost and dubious morality of terrorist warfare, and the film fairly showcases the brutality inflicted by both groups."The Battle of Algiers" has an astounding authentic quality to it that makes it almost impossible to believe that this is a fictional film and not a documentary.Grade: A',9,'16 April 2007','0058946');

	values('ur0855231','Why do people riot? Why do things become so pent up, that the only solution to the ill-feeling is a violent eruption of chaos and violence? In post-war Britain, probably the worst of what immediately preceded the events that unfold in "La Haine" occurred in 1981 and 2011, when communities and often entire cities burnt for several days with conflicting explanations as to why. Conclusions are often reached along racial; economic and moral grounds - might all play their own part?Commenting on 1981, John Tyndall lamented as to how it was inevitable that trouble would erupt when non-white citizens, often of a completely different temperament; character and cultural stock, were thrust into compact post-war urban areas not built for this purpose. The Prime Minister of the time, Margaret Thatcher, blamed in her memoir unemployment and the erosion of moral fibre brought about by 60s reform: personal pride and a sense of community had disappeared. Explaining away the nightmare of 2011, Laurie Penny deduced an austerity drive on the things that made life bearable (youth centres and jobseekers allowances) as being the catalyst for the trouble - that, and the incessant police harassment.France is not a place I can speak for with any tremendous authority - I imagine the deductions are largely the same. When, years ago, I first saw "La Haine", a 1995 guerrilla film starring amateurs and made by first timers, I found it kinetic and oddly enjoyable in the way an action film might be. Seeing it a second time, I was struck by how little I appreciated it first time as a piece told from a characters (Hubert) point of view as he worried for the future of one of his friends, who seemed to be heading the way of violence and criminality. Watching it years later; being able to appreciate its social commentaries, and the particularly fine lines the film treads between taking sides within these commentaries, has embedded it as one of my all-time favourite films."La Haine" unfolds in the wake of a night of severe rioting in a Parisian suburb, with characters SaÃ¯d (SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui); Vincent (Vincent Cassel) and the aforementioned Hubert (Hubert KoundÃ©) being those whom the film follows. The three are Arabic; Jewish and black - deliberately epitomising the diversity of the banlieues. There is evident tension between the cops and the local kids, pre-eminently down to the fact a local boy named Abdul - a friend of the threesome - has been beaten so badly he is in hospital.Meanwhile, somebody somewhere on the estate has a policemans gun which was lost amidst the chaos - things could blow up at any moment. Capturing the sense of a group fighting against the odds, Mathieu Kassovitz begins the piece with a character quoting from "The Magnificent Seven", while another character separately re-enacts scenes from "Taxi Driver", which of course ended in a bloody rampage when the lead becomes besotted with firearms.The film portrays a society tearing itself apart, confirming said notion through the use of Huberts narration, although how accurate the warning shot has proven to be can only be answered by somebody living on the frontline of where it depicts. Perhaps unsubtly, Kassovitz interjects coverage of the crisis in Bosnia unfolding at the same time on a large television screen as the boys wait around at a shopping mall - it is no coincidence, with "La Haine" already all too keen to remind us that Paris is a melting pot of skinheads; middle class Le Pen voters; kids from the ghetto and metropolitan champagne-socialist types who, even when the problem lands flush at their feet, are clueless as to how to respond to it.But the film is far from a mere hatchet job - there is no feeling sorry for ones self, or providing the audience with soppy lectures on how its all everybody elses fault. In the wake of the rioting; burning and generalised madness, it is the working man and the very people who live in the banlieues who suffer most: fire has gutted the gym Hubert owned, while another friend had his car torched overnight and so cannot go to work in order to live. There is a palpable sense that the rioting has only incensed the police further and very little political ground has been gained. Just who is the winner here?Writing for Sight and Sound in 1995, Keith Reader quotes Kassovitz that "La Haine" is meant to be understood as an anti-police film, but the police are rarely portrayed as anything else other than people merely trying to do their job: the clearing of a rooftop picnic; guarding Abduls hospital room, etc. Later on in central Paris, SaÃ¯d is stunned at how one policeman even refers to him as sir when getting directions and a plain clothes officer back on the estate is more than helpful in his relationship with the boys. Nobody, however, could condone the behaviour of our leads when they gate-crash a gallery, nor indeed wish that anybody might escape the police pursuit which erupts in the wake of somebody taking aim at a cop car with a shotgun.The film still holds that kinetic feel to it years later. That is despite the fact it is far from some kind of deliberately made entertainment - shootings and getaways occur, but they are not designed to put smiles on our faces. Like war films, we grimace at the sound of a gun, which may or may not be the point Kassovitz is trying to make: like Bosnia, Paris is a warzone, albeit only comparatively. When, however, the three lads are stuck in the centre of the city; Vincent begins to feel compelled to shoot a policeman and desperation sets in, the film cannot help but excrete a kind of rabid energy maybe akin to the final acts of a blockbuster. Unquestionably, the film is one of raw power and energy; at once terrifying and alarming - one which is startling every time it is viewed.',10,'26 June 2008','0113247');

Selznick might have had more of an influence over this production than some might think- as with many of his films- and he is the one who ended up receiving the Oscar, not director Alfred Hitchcok, for the 1940 mystery-drama-romance Rebecca. But it is to the credit of both that, for the most part, it looks as if both tried to stay out of each others way and just put up as good as film as they could. And it is a credit to Hitchcock that with a certain change from what one might see in his perhaps more entertaining films of the 50s and 60s also shows his knack at making great romantic Hollywood movie-making. He is given a plethora of the best of English acting talents (Olivier of course is hyped and hyped again just like Brando, but his work is undeniably good here, and yet its Joan Fontaine who quietly makes her mark quite powerfully even when she is reserved in scenes), lush sets and production decor, a solid studio score by Frank Waxman, and some memorable sequences and set-pieces. There is also some solid storytelling as well with his usual knack at unraveling a mystery piece by piece, with love, loss and deception at the core.Part of the films success, however, is as attributable to the factor of it being one of the best "chick-flicks" in history that the film works today. And this time I mean it pretty much as a compliment, perhaps more to Selznick than anyone (Gone with the Wind, of course). The appeal that might usually go mostly for women is not lost at all on the male audience due to the sheer power and hints at what the two main actresses go for. Fontaine is the "2nd" Mrs. De Winter, who elopes with the Mr. played by Olivier and goes to live in Manderlay and meets some of the family and other folks. One of these is the one who has maybe the most interesting (naturally, as the antagonist) character, Mrs. Danvers played by Judith Anderson. Hers is a cold, exacting kind of character who has the straightforward, stern attitude of the maam of the house, but also with some dark secrets. Its not to say Hitchcock doesnt hav his eye out for other supporting parts and characters (I liked particularly the old guy whos at the shack where the majority of the secrets are house). But he also is able to get the character the audience will dislike the most as the more fascinating of the bunch, and Anderson is up to task.I wouldnt rush to see this as the first Hithcock film to see if you havent seen one yet, but as an example of what he could direct aside from his outrageous and masterpiece works in the following years this is a fit example. Its also got, basically, an excellent story, and is pumped up with the best of Hollywood decorum and spectacle, with a big fire of an ending that practically on its own makes it worthwhile enough to see.',10,'5 June 2006','0032976');

	values('ur1416505','Its of course ridicules to call this movie a bad one but as far as so called new wave French movies go, this isnt the best example of it, in my opinion.Cant really see how people can call this one of the most powerful and emotional dramas ever made, unless you perhaps had a tough youth yourself and can identify yourself with its young main character. Perhaps its also due to the fact that it is of course being placed in a totally different time period, at also a different country and culture but personally I couldnt really place myself in his shoes because throughout the movie hes doing some things that I cant see myself ever doing or saying to someone.But this is perhaps also one of the powers of the movie, at the same time. Its not showing things and people as just black and white, good or bad but it more shows that nobody is truly a good or a bad person. Sometimes it are certain circumstances that force us to do things in order to survive in this world. Whether or not you like it, you sometimes have to do things you know youre later going to regret.In that regard this is a quite good random slice of life, or a coming of age movie. You could take the movie both these ways really, since it for a change is a movie that entirely focuses on its young main character and tells the entire story from his perspective. Its an original but also risky approach to the genre, that in this case did work out, also really thanks to Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud, who plays the young boy.So it all in all really remains a well put together movie, by FranÃ§ois Truffaut, that just didnt really ever got to me at a more emotional level. Extra praise should be send Truffauts way though, since this movie actually was his first full length movie and he made at a quite a young age as well. Definitely not a bad first movie by him, though thankfully still he and his movies grew better over the years.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/',7,'9 October 2011','0053198');

This was another amazing film from Park Chan-wook. His films are always brilliant and this was no exception! It was such a beautiful LGBTQ story and Im happy to have watched it.The cinematography was stunning and artistic, with bleak yet beautiful colour palettes, it was always pleasing to the eye. There was some really good shot transitions and I loved the camera tracking too. Overall, the film was just very well shot!I loved the characters and really felt for them, this was helped by phenomenal acting from everyone involved. The dialogue was sharp and witty too. The two main actresses had amazing on-screen chemistry and their characters felt so different in interesting ways, it was beautiful to see them come together.The music and score were equally as amazing, and only added to the beauty and emotion of the film. Also, the sound mixing was effective and the lack of score nearer the end made it so much more powerful and impactful!The film was paced steadily and slowly, with interesting structure as its split into parts. The tone is mostly very sensual and beautiful, but the film includes some intense twists and turns that dramatic change the tone at times which I liked, this kept me hooked. It was all super unexpected. In addition, it actually gets quite disturbing and theres a lot to digest (I mean this positively). And overall, I loved how the filmmakers pieced the story together.',9,'18 May 2022','4016934');

While some parts are quite idealistic, it is essentially a screwball romantic comedy and a great one at that. The direction from Frank Capra is classy and dignified and cleverly gives us an insight into gender and class status, and the screenplay is sophisticated and funny. The humour still works, I found myself laughing when Clark Gable said "now dont tell youre in love with the bus driver" for example. The cinematography is beautiful and dynamic and the music is richly and sensitively scored. The acting is very, very good. Clark Gable looks handsome here, and he gives a close to hysterical performance as Peter, with his impeccable comic timing and witty humour. Claudette Colbert is lovely as Ellie, the spoiled yet somewhat independent heiress who Peter falls for. The two actors show great, charming chemistry together on screen, and they are terrifically supported by especially Walter Connolly as Andrews. The story is relatively simple, but I liked its simplicity, it was effective. Overall, a wonderful, funny and charming film. 10/10 Bethany Cox',10,'6 April 2010','0025316');

	values('ur1355003','After my first viewing of Persona I was unsure what exactly to make of it. Even after a second viewing, it is still hard to say what exactly Persona is about. This is not a negative trait though, but rather a curious characteristic. In fact, the overall film is perhaps best described as "curious". I would not call Persona a flawless film, but regardless of whether Bergmans film is flawed or flawless, it stimulates one to think, and that is certainly a good quality. I will now provide some thoughts on the film, in light of having viewed it a second time. I do not know how valid all of my comments are - they are just some thoughts on the material. Unfortunately it is hard to discuss the film without possible spoilers, so be warned: my review may spoil a fresh experience of the movie.First and foremost, I would label Persona as a horror film. After my initial viewing of the film, I had it down as a psychological drama, but now I think that it not only has elements of horror, but that it is dominantly a horror film. I guess it depends a lot on how you view the twist. I have heard other discuss how the two characters, Alma and Elisabeth, share the same personality - that they are the same person, but represent two personae for which every person has: the outer self (Alma, who talks) and the inner self (Elisabeth, who listens). This is quite an interesting theory, and after discussing it with some others who had seen the film, I became convince of the theory that Alma and Elisabeth are in fact the same person the whole time through.Now, it does not quite seem so clear. Watching it again, I was on the lookout for clues. There are some hints in that direction - the way the two women interact when together at the seaside property, the way that they seem to be opposites, but yet share similar ideas. The whole time I could sense communication even though, for the most part, only Alma was talking. However, Bergman throws in a number of elements that violate the theory that they are both the same person. Often he forces us to take the third person, stopping us from entering into the minds of either character. There is a female doctor in the mix, who communicates with both Alma and Elisabeth as if they are different persons. Then, there is also some narration by a man when the two women arrive at the seaside home.Yet, another theory comes into play, and a rather satisfying one. In one of their conversations, Alma tells Elisabeth that she feels that she could turn into her. She feels that they are so alike in subtle ways that they could easily become each other. Following the announcement of this idea, we hear Elisabeth finally say something that Alma ignores, but then repeats herself. Are they starting to become one another, like Alma had just talked about? It seems as if Elisabeth and Alma were separate persons, however something supernatural, for whatever reason, occurred and they suddenly either became one person or switched personalities.I still find it hard to work out what exactly Bergman is getting at, and his encouragement of the third person approach vexes me. I would not flaw the film too much for that though. Perhaps it was meant to be ambiguous. Bergman does a great job filming the material, and for skill this definitely gets top marks. The setting is excellent, and strangely reminiscent of The Seventh Seal (plus notice how Ullmann looks like Death at times!). The bleakness of the sets is captured perfectly in black and white, with many close-ups to show the intimacy of the story. There is also one brilliantly filmed shot, in which the camera pans for an unbroken half minute or more, as the two women run across the beach.Bergmans vision of the material is startling good. When Mr. Vogler arrives on set, there is some triangular framing going on, with interesting shots positioning Elisabeth in a removed position from Alma and her husband, but yet with all three of them in frame. There is also the repeated segment in which we see the reaction of Elisabeth when Alma is talking to her, and then it switches to show the facial expressions of Alma. I would not praise all of Bergmans techniques here though. Some of his shots just go on from an incredibly long time without much reason, which could cause one to wonder whether he was just trying to buff up the short running time. There is a shot towards the beginning of the film in which Ullmann stares blankly for a whole minute or more, and there is another shot which focuses on an irrelevant task of cleaning up a broken pot. Some shots like those could have been cut shorter. The other part of Bergmans vision that I am not fond of is the beginning segment. While the child could possibly have meaning, some of the other images in the montage, such animal killings, crucifixions and cartoons, seem thrown in for the sake of it. The intermission, while rather chilling, annoys me a bit too. I am not sure if it was inserted in the best possible place, or how meaningful its images are. But thats all minor stuff.One last thing to praise is of course the acting. It is the acting, not the dialogue, which makes the film so intense during its middle section. When Andersson was describing her rendezvous on the beach, I was concentrating on her face, and that was telling me more than the subtitles. Ullmann also has a very expressive face, perfect for her somewhat muted character. I wish I could say more here, but I dont set the word limit.',10,'5 November 2005','0060827');

Its so funny and some of the scenes are so sharp with lots of historical in jokes. As someone involved in politics I particularly love the idea that Reg our glorious leader cant go on the raid as he has a bad back yet hes happy to martyr the rest of the team. And when they call for a meeting and pass motions it is as Judith says perfectly simple Reg that they should just go and try and stop the Romans nailing him up. And Brians success is greeted with shocked surprise and the announcement that we need doers in our movement (unlike Reg). Another highlight has to be Reg asking what have the Romans ever done for us.

However, his genius stands apart from any particular genre, and this film is a stunning case in point.Faced with such unpromising material as a story about the friendship between a Russian army officer and an aging hunter, set in Siberia in the early 1900s, most film-makers would run screaming for cover. Kurosawa revels in the story, and creates a true cinematic masterpiece.While the heart of the film is the human relationship between the "Capitan" and Dersu, the main star of the film is the Siberian wilderness itself. Rarely can such loving care have been lavished on ensuring that the natural beauty of a location comes through onto the celluloid. Some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed: the group round the campfire with the river in the background and the wind whipping up; the sequence where the captain and Dersu have to cut reeds to make a shelter as night falls and a storm approaches; the night-time scene (I kid you not!) of the group dragging a sledge across an icy waste.The simple story of exploration, man versus nature, and the evolution of a true friendship is both thought-provoking and deeply touching. The tiny Maksim Munzuk is superb as the title character and Yuri Solomin is a study of restraint in the role of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (upon whose actual journals the story is based).This is one of those rare films that you can watch twice back-to-back, or at any time to restore your belief that, in addition to being a means of mass entertainment, movies really can be an art form as well.',10,'15 February 2000','0071411');

In-jokes aside, the movie visually borrows from other Disney product (particularly "Sleeping Beauty" towards the end), not to mention "Raiders of the Lost Ark". It doesnt seem to have much spirit of its own apart from Robin Williams and his vocal hamming (which was seen as a tour-de-force in its time). There are funny bits and pieces, beautiful designs and scene transitions, and the romance between the young people comes off well. Its a little screechy and a little staid, with illogical rewrites to the Aladdin legend which do nothing but prolong the inevitable; however, the Disney magic is in evidence and the film is satisfying on a non-think level. **1/2 from ****',6,'23 March 2009','0103639');

	values('ur2382545','Until very recently major Hollywood Studios seldom attempted to produce biographies, but when they did the subjects were usually legendary figures or long dead historic characters that impose few restraints on the screenwriters freedom - some pseudo-biographies even featured fictional characters. We have only to think of The Ten commandments, Cleopatra, Jason and the Argonauts or even Ben Hur to recognise that freedom from the rigours of historical veracity is the first requirement for the production of such epics. It is British films which have established an enviable reputation for widely acclaimed biographies that do not seriously distort historical facts. These include such masterpieces as Lawrence of Arabia, The Young Winston, Elizabeth (1998), Isadora, and That Hamilton Woman. Richard Attenboroughs "Gandhi" also takes a very high place in this collection. As a Hindu mystic Gandhi is not an easy character for a Western European to fully appreciate but after watching this film one does really begin to develop some understanding of his life and times. Historically there are only a few recorded triumphs of non-violent revolts over the government of the day - the best known are probably the rise of Christianity in pagan Rome, and the independence of India from the British Raj. The latter is better documented, and this film is significant because of the way in which it shows how non-violent protest can be successful against what appear to be all the odds. However this is of less importance than the fine re-creation of life as it was lived in India at the time, and the magnificent acting - particularly the award winning performance of Ben Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi. The film is lengthy (running for 188 min.) but utterly fascinating, and not overlong as it has such a vast sprawling canvas to cover. It should certainly be seen by every film lover. However it is probably best viewed in two parts as it is too fine a work to allow ones attention to flag.In the 20 years since this film was made the indigenous Indian film industry has developed to the point where there are now some very fine Indian Directors and a large pool of other talent. There have also been some changes in historical perspectives because of the ongoing friction between Hindus and Muslims on the Indian subcontinent. It can only be a matter of time before an Indian production company creates a new film about Gandhis life from a strictly Indian point of view. When this occurs it will make a fascinating comparison with this film which still remains one of the truly great screen biographies. I really look forward to the release of such a film.',0,'15 October 2003','0083987');
